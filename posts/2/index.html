  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> developer. I&rsquo;ve only used Node to play around with JavaScript, not for any real work or personal projects (yet). The last time I used Node was two months ago, for a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/pittsburgh-tech-fest-2013-my-talk-stop-overusing-regular-expressions/">talk I gave at Pittsburgh TechFest 2013</a> in which I wrote JavaScript code running on Node, but did not actually talk about it, and only mentioned that I had written it and put it up on my <a href="https://github.com/franklinchen/talk-on-overusing-regular-expressions">GitHub repository for the talk</a>.</p>

<p>That is why it took me so long to attend my first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/">Pittsburgh Node</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/events/128439692/">meeting</a>. I was simply curious who was involved in the local Node community and what tooling they were using. The meeting was about <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, a Make-like task runner. Nate Good of ShowClix presented.</p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>There was a fairly large group of people who attended: around thirty. Node seems to be popular in town.</p>

<h2>The talk</h2>

<p>Overall, Grunt seemed like Make or Rake. You can use plugins and define your own tasks. So there seemed nothing special about it, other than it is a useful tool corresponding to similar tools for other language ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Since I don&rsquo;t really use Node, I went to the meetup out of curiosity more than anything else. I will probably not attend again. There seemed a lot of enthusiasm though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby">Pittsburgh Ruby meetup</a> held a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/120200102">lightning talks session</a>.</p>

<p>Originally, I was not going to present anything, since I did not feel that I had anything exciting to quickly share (I have not been doing much Ruby programming lately at all other than <a href="/blog/2013/06/29/nil-non-determinism-exceptions">debugging my Octopress-generated blog</a>), and don&rsquo;t like talking just to talk.</p>

<p>But at the very last minute, just half an hour before the meeting, I noticed some developments in the world of <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> announced on Twitter by Jim Weirich, and I got excited enough that I decided to talk about his <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given"><code>rspec-given</code></a>, which was just released at version 3.0.0.</p>

<p>Because the topic of the featured presentation by <a href="http://idiotcoder.com/">Richard Ashkettle</a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>, I made sure to attend my first meeting of the newly revived <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript/">Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup</a>. (This was actually the third meeting of the revived Pittsburgh JavaScript group, but I hadn&rsquo;t been able to make it to the first two.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d met Richard earlier, a month ago at <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/report-on-the-second-pittsburgh-techfest-2013/">Pittsburgh TechFest</a>. He does not claim to be an expert at functional programming, but is enthusiastic about concepts and techniques that he can and does apply to improving software quality in many dimensions. Since I have been a functional programming enthusiast and practitioner for twenty years, I had these goals in attending his presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li>evaluate what Richard and others have done with, and think is important about,  functional programming</li>
<li>offer a few corrections, elaborations, suggestions as appropriate for the situation</li>
<li>gather information on how I may be able to effectively explain functional programming to those who are new to it</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/30/why-i-hate-calling-myself-pragmatic-but-do/">post on my personal blog about my being a &ldquo;pragmatist&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>I mention it here because few words are as controversial, I think, in the programming community, as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo;. I wanted to be on record as identifying myself as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; despite the negative connotations, because the entire mindset of this new programming blog is pragmatic.</p>

<p>For example, I will soon write about the realities of programming language choice, including why I used Java, despite its deficiencies, for a decade, and why it is not going away, and why I currently am an advocate of <em>Scala, one of the most ambitiously pragmatic languages</em> to have come along in my lifetime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned in my <a href="/blog/2013/06/24/introducing-this-new-programming-blog/">initial post for this blog</a> that I have had some problems with the software I use to generate my personal blog, <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, and was thinking of migrating to a different platform that might in some ways be more robust to such problems. I ended up not doing so, and I still stand by that decision, but I just yet again ran into a problem with Octopress.</p>

<p>Here I report on how I figured out the problem and begin a conversation about the nature of error handling and API design.</p>

I recently encountered a problem: auto-updating of apps failed with this terrible error message:</p>

<blockquote><p>Application cannot be installed in the default install location.</p></blockquote>


<p>Also, a lot of time and bandwidth was each time spent on re-downloading the app and then failing, with no way to gracefully recover.</p>

<p>If you search the Web for this unpleasant error message, you will see hundreds if not thousands of confused end users like me asking on various forums how to deal with this.</p>

<p>I feel pretty bad about this situation, both as a programmer and as an end user.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/b/e/global_187797022.jpeg" title="Pittsburgh Python User Group" ></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pghpython/">Pittsburgh Python User Group</a> had <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pghpython/events/120442102">another &ldquo;favorite module night&rdquo;</a>. I enjoy this format because I get to learn about what people find useful, so that I may perhaps use it myself!</p>

<h2>How I benefited in the past</h2>

<p>For example, <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/23/pittsburgh-python-meetup-i-gave-my-first-lightning-talk-ever-the-topic-was-scons/">one of these &ldquo;favorite module night&rdquo; sessions</a> was where I learned about Kenneth Reitz&rsquo;s <code>requests</code> library. Very often it is easy to not be aware of the rapidly changing ecology of very useful libraries in a programming language ecosystem outside of the official &ldquo;standard library&rdquo;, especially when using a language that is <em>not</em> one&rsquo;s primary working language. For example, Python has never been one of my primary working languages, so I&rsquo;m not as up to date on what all the best tools are to use. But just a couple of weeks ago, I had to do some work with Python, and <code>requests</code> came in very handy.</p>

<h2><a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a></h2>

<p>Josh Adelman opened the show-and-tell with a demo of <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>. This is a truly fantastic interactive environment for developing code while creating a full document for publication and sharing. He uses it not only for research but also for his students to use in his teaching.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used Mathematica, the concept is similar to that environment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also excited that IPython Notebook has been the direct inspiration for similar projects for other languages, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/Bridgewater/scala-notebook">Scala Notebook</a> for Scala in development.</p>

<p>Josh gave a link to this <a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/">cool blog that uses IPython Notebook</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://getsentry.com/welcome/">Sentry</a> and <a href="http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Raven</a></h2>

<p>Nick Sloan presented on Sentry, a service for collecting errors in your program and notifying you of them, and Raven, the official Python client for Sentry. Sentry is actually open source, so you could host it yourself, but paying for the hosted service provides conveniences.</p>

<p>Using Sentry is no more than using ordinary Python logging after calling a setup function. The ease of use made it sound like a winner.</p>

<h2><a href="http://docopt.org/">docopt</a></h2>

<p>Joe Esposito presented on <code>docopt</code>, a library for command line parsing. The interesting thing about it is that it implements an <em>external</em> domain-specific language for describing command lines: you write a usage message, as a string, and <code>docopt</code> parses it in order to deduce what the expectations and constraints are. This is a very ambitious approach, contrary to the usual internal API-based approaches, some of which are sophisticated and implement an <em>internal</em> domain-specific language.</p>

<p>Of course, Joe contrasted this library with one of the standard command line parsing libraries for Python, <code>argparse</code>, which is lower-level so that when you use it, the high-level end user usage is not as immediately readable.</p>

<p>There were a lot of good questions about <code>docopt</code> since it seemed magical. I&rsquo;ve decided to write more about all this in a separate blog post about command line parsers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hypothesis">hypothesis</a></h2>

<p>I gave a short 5-minute presentation on <code>hypothesis</code>, a library in development for doing property-based testing, inspired by QuickCheck and ScalaCheck. As I have done recently when giving a much longer <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/11/my-pittsburgh-scala-meetup-talk-on-property-based-testing-using-scalacheck/">talk on property-based testing using ScalaCheck</a>, I focused on motivating the use of property-based testing as an addition to example-based testing.</p>

<p>Materials for my lightning talk are <a href="https://github.com/franklinchen/lightning-talk-on-hypothesis">here</a>, and my few slides are below:</p>

<p> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/FranklinChen/handout-23548866" title="5-minute intro to property-based testing in Python with hypothesis" target="_blank">5-minute intro to property-based testing in Python with hypothesis</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/FranklinChen" target="_blank">Franklin Chen</a></strong> </div></p>

<h2><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html"><code>itertools</code></a></h2>

<p>Tim Lesher talked about <code>itertools</code>, a very useful part of the standard library that provides support for efficient functional programming idioms. Part of the efficiency comes from the use of iterators in order to avoid constructing intermediate lists; this is a way of simulating the lazy sequences that are standard in languages such as ML, Haskell, Scala, and Clojure.</p>

<p>Tim noted that although <code>itertools</code> is powerful, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be stupid&rdquo;: don&rsquo;t write obscure-looking code with it just because you can.</p>

<p>Josh noted that the documentation for <code>itertools</code> is great, with recipes that show you not only how to do things, and also with code for the equivalent more complicated code that you would have to write if you didn&rsquo;t use <code>itertools</code>. I agree that the documentation for <code>itertools</code> is a model of high-quality documentation for a library. Check it out, and use it!</p>

<h2><a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html"><code>argparse</code></a></h2>

<p>Craig gave a little presentation on <code>argparse</code>, the aforementioned standard library for command line parsing. He noted it was ironic that he had prepared to speak on it before Joe independently decided to talk about <code>docopt</code>. (Actually, I like <code>argparse</code> and had considered talking about it before Craig submitted it already.)</p>

<p>One feature he uses from <code>argparse</code> is the ability to create mutually exclusive groups. There was a question of whether this is supported in <code>docopt</code>.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;ll write more about both <code>argparse</code> and <code>docopt</code> in a separate blog post.</p>

<h2><a href="http://doughellmann.com/python-standard-library-by-example">The Python Standard Library by Example</a></h2>

<p>Someone shared not a &ldquo;favorite module&rdquo;, but a favorite book, &ldquo;The Python Standard Library by Example&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m happy he did, because it is in fact an excellent reference for anyone using the Python standard library, with concrete examples that you can take and use. Too often, I have found that standard documentation is too terse.</p>

<p>The book is based on <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/">&ldquo;Python Module of the Week&rdquo;</a>, which is a great online resource.</p>

<h2>Introductions for new people</h2>

<p>An important part of the vibe of the Pittsburgh Python User Group is how it tries to get everyone actively involved in the local Python community.</p>

<p>There is a tradition of periodically having everyone introduce themselves, to counter the tendency sometimes in these kinds of groups for people to attend a meeting out of curiosity and then silently leave and perhaps not come back, out of intimidation or not knowing how to benefit or contribute. I know I have done that before, especially when attending the meeting of a group where I didn&rsquo;t really know anybody ahead of time and still knew very little about the topics discussed by the group (such as when I joined the Pittsburgh Ruby group as one who had barely used any Ruby).</p>

<p>Since so many people showed up, and a lot seemed to be new faces, we had a round of introductions. I hope we&rsquo;ll continue to see some of these new faces in the future!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks again to Google Pittsburgh for hosting the Pittsburgh Python User Group meeting, and Steve Gross of Google for being the guy who makes it able for us to meet there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The topic for the featured presentation at the <a href="http://java.net/projects/pittjug/">Pittsburgh Java User Group</a> (PittJUG) was &ldquo;Building and Evolving a Java API&rdquo;, presented by Eric Stein of <a href="http://www.fulminatus.com/">Fulminatus Consulting</a>. I was excited to attend because API design is difficult but important, and today more than ever, because of the trend toward integrating many services to build an application, and toward providing such services (both externally and internally).</p>

<p>(For past reports of mine on PittJUG, see the <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/categories/pittjug/">PittJUG archives in my other blog</a>.)</p>

<p>The presentation was very good. (Eric&rsquo;s slides are available <a href="http://www.fulminatus.com/presentations/PittJUG%20API%20Presentation.pdf">here</a>, but as always with slides, be aware that it is just an outline, as good slides really should be, and the actual presentation and group discussion had all the substance.) Note that although some of the specific recommendations and examples are Java-specific, the entire area of good API design is <em>general</em> and is applicable no matter what programming language you are using.</p>

<p>However, the presentation also filled me with a combination of <em>sadness</em>, because our computing profession could have done better up front to make good API design much easier in various ways. On the positive side, it&rsquo;s better late than never.</p>

<p>A report on the presentation, with my commentary:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi. My name is Franklin Chen. I already have a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/">personal Web site and blog</a>.</p>

<p>But I ended up only writing <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/categories/programming/">a little bit about programming on that blog</a>.</p>

<p>So I decided it was time to start a separate blog to devoted entirely to computer programming. The problem with the all-in-one personal blog was that I ended up never really working up a momentum to post the kinds of articles I wanted to write about programming.</p>

<h2>Why &ldquo;The Conscientious Programmer&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>At some point in the past year or two, I reflected on how I could best summarize my attitudes and aspirations as a programmer, as someone who loves programming and also works as a professional software developer.</p>

<p>I came up with the decidedly non-sexy term <em>conscientious programmer</em>. It is also a term that requires explanation, because you could easily interpret it as having a connotation that is moralistic, pretentious, or boring!</p>

<p>It is impossible to summarize in a sound bite what I mean by the term, so I have created this blog in order to continually illustrate, by example, the kinds of technical and other issues that come up in software development that I grapple with.</p>

<p>However, since a sound bite is required in some circumstances, here&rsquo;s what I currently have:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am a conscientious computer programmer, committed to designing, building, and testing correct, efficient, documented, maintainable software that meets users&#8217; real needs.</p></blockquote>


<p>My material will come from my own experiences (successes and failures, past and present) as well as from those of others. See the <a href="/about/">About page</a> for more sound bites about what this blog will be about.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start immediately with my personal experience from just the past couple of days!</p>

<h2>Future topics</h2>

<p>But first, here is a little sample of topics I will write about in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>positive and negative experiences with statically typed languages</li>
<li>positive and negative experiences with dynamically typed languages</li>
<li>the good and bad of the polyglot programming world</li>
<li>what is object-oriented programming anyway?</li>
<li>what is functional programming anyway?</li>
<li>Agile notions</li>
<li>test-driven development, behavior-driven development, other testing topics</li>
<li>static analysis</li>
<li>code performance</li>
<li>human performance</li>
<li>controversies over the adjective &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo;</li>
<li>how much theory should one know or use?</li>
<li>how to teach</li>
<li>how to learn</li>
<li>how to focus and not be a dilettante</li>
<li>how to spread ideas</li>
<li>is syntax important?</li>
<li>are macros a good idea?</li>
<li>are unsound type systems justified?</li>
<li>what is a type system anyway or what should it be?</li>
<li>monads</li>
<li>editors and IDEs</li>
<li>are software patterns a mistake in disguise?</li>
<li>software evolution and maintenance</li>
<li>planning for the future vs. getting it done today</li>
<li>role of emotion in decision making</li>
<li>what is &ldquo;community&rdquo;?</li>
<li>politics of open source vs. free software</li>
<li>open standards</li>
<li>questions of diversity in our profession</li>
<li>education</li>
</ul>


<h2>The dilemmas I encountered when deciding to create this blog</h2>

<p>I already encountered a dilemma some years ago when I thought that I should have a personal blog to regularly post to. I had messed around with Blogger and WordPress and they were not at all suitable for me. Luckily, I discovered <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and it got me going very quickly. I&rsquo;m still using it.</p>

<p>If all were going smoothly with the personal blog, then I probably would not have any dilemma when deciding to create the new blog; I would just use exactly the same Octopress platform.</p>

<p><em>Or would I?</em></p>

<h3>Desire for novelty: good or bad?</h3>

<p>I am not immune to the thrill of novelty. I am not an extreme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter">early adopter</a>, but I also do not entirely subscribe to the philosophy <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_it_ain%27t_broke,_don%27t_fix_it">&ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo;</a>. I like opportunities for doing something differently and better than in the past, but I like to evaluate these rationally. This is an example of what I mean by &ldquo;conscientious programmer&rdquo;: <em>always be aware of risks and tradeoffs when making any kind of decision</em>.</p>

<p>One thing that is sometimes forgotten in the rush to make a decision is that it is premature to immediately start making lists of risks and tradeoffs. First, you have to step back and figure out what the real goals are. Many projects fail because the assessments and the followup actions were <em>correct</em>, but toward the <em>wrong</em> goal. <em>Solving the correct problem</em> is more important than <em>solving the wrong problem correctly</em>.</p>

<p>In the case of choosing which software to use for my new blog, there were actually several considerations.</p>

<h3>Unstable branch of Octopress</h3>

<p>Octopress&rsquo;s stable <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress"><code>master</code> branch</a> is a continuation of version 2.0. At some point for my personal blog, I got excited about trying out the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/tree/2.1">unstable <code>2.1</code> branch</a> because of various improvements. I migrated over, and periodically endured a surprising amount of pain. It wasn&rsquo;t just because I had to manually move files around and resolve merge conflicts and refactor my config files, but also bugs kept popping up, and I had to spend time fixing them.</p>

<p>In retrospect, <em>it was a mistake being an early adopter</em> of branch <code>2.1</code>. I stopped pulling and merging over a month ago, when it became clear that the migration to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> 1.0 was causing major refactorings by the developers of the Octopress <code>2.1</code> branch that were breaking everything on my blog.</p>

<p>It would <em>not</em> have been a mistake if my goal were to help test and develop Octopress. That is a noble goal, because Octopress has been a <em>huge</em> positive contributor to the world of blogging, as a static site generator that is programmable and comes with a good default theme (which I still use). But my <em>real goal</em> is to write and post content, not spend my time fixing or configuring Octopress.</p>

<h3>Coming back to Octopress <code>master</code> branch?</h3>

<p>The official recommendation of the Octopress team right now (<a href="https://twitter.com/octopress/status/348465809624027136">as of two days ago, June 22</a>) is to use <code>master</code>, because once <code>2.1</code> is cleaned up, it will actually become <code>3.0</code> and there will be a tested migration path from <code>2.0</code>.</p>

<p>I confess to having a psychological resistance to &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo;, for this new blog, from my <code>2.1</code>-based setup on my personal blog, but this is exactly the moment when it is necessary to remember that I want to be a <em>conscientious</em> programmer.</p>

<h3>Switching to a new blogging platform?</h3>

<p>The idea also occurred to me to use a completely different blogging platform. <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> has always seemed appealing to me, because it is driven by Haskell (Octopress is driven by Ruby). I prefer programming in Haskell to programming in Ruby, both because of the static type safety and because of the expected considerable performance improvement in site generation (right now, full generation of my personal blog takes a very long time).</p>

<p>But after looking at Hakyll, and being tempted to get into it, I decided that my real goal is <em>not</em> to spend a lot of time hacking Haskell as a personal side project, and creating cool themes and features for Hakyll, but to get a blog up and running so that I can focus on content for the blog. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">Bikeshedding</a> is not what I&rsquo;m here for.</p>

<p>So I used Octopress again for this new blog.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are interested in using Octopress, here is a great <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/applications/getting-started-with-octopress/">tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3>Flexibility</h3>

<p>Another thing I try to remember is to avoid getting backed into a corner when it comes to decision-making. I like to think about the future as well as the present. <em>What if&hellip;?</em></p>

<p>I know that if I wanted to, in the future I could switch blogging platforms at will, by doing some programming. The decisions that I am making <em>now</em> are not irreversible. Using a programmable static site generator means that I have full control over paths, styles, generation of RSS feeds, insertion of JavaScript-based features (such as the <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> commenting system), etc.</p>

<p>Thinking up front about the future and how it might be different and what I might need or want to do in the future is not just idle daydreaming; I find it an essential final step in making a decision <em>now</em> and focusing on action <em>now</em>, with the peace of mind that I no longer have to worry about the future because I already have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_B">Plan B</a>. We must always assume possible failure and future change. But we don&rsquo;t have to panic about it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started this new programming blog, using the stable <code>master</code> branch of Octopress. I hope we&rsquo;ll share some interesting experiences here!</p>
