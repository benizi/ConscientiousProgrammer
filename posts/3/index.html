  <div class="entry-content"><p>Programming meetups aren&rsquo;t just about presentations and coding. Abby and I joined others in meeting up for dinner for a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/120201652/">joint Pittsburgh Ruby and Pittsburgh Python social</a> and enjoyed relaxing and socializing outdoors in Bakery Square. Although it perpetually looked like it was going to rain, it turned out we weren&rsquo;t really rained on.</p>

<p>It was fitting that there was a joint social for two language communities, because we live in a polyglot world.</p>

<p>Despite my original intention not to engage into any tech-related conversation, I couldn&rsquo;t help remarking on my current polyglot responsibilities at work at CMU on the METAL project!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> developer. I&rsquo;ve only used Node to play around with JavaScript, not for any real work or personal projects (yet). The last time I used Node was two months ago, for a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/pittsburgh-tech-fest-2013-my-talk-stop-overusing-regular-expressions/">talk I gave at Pittsburgh TechFest 2013</a> in which I wrote JavaScript code running on Node, but did not actually talk about it, and only mentioned that I had written it and put it up on my <a href="https://github.com/franklinchen/talk-on-overusing-regular-expressions">GitHub repository for the talk</a>.</p>

<p>That is why it took me so long to attend my first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/">Pittsburgh Node</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/events/128439692/">meeting</a>. I was simply curious who was involved in the local Node community and what tooling they were using. The meeting was about <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, a Make-like task runner. Nate Good of ShowClix presented.</p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>There was a fairly large group of people who attended: around thirty. Node seems to be popular in town.</p>

<h2>The talk</h2>

<p>Overall, Grunt seemed like Make or Rake. You can use plugins and define your own tasks. So there seemed nothing special about it, other than it is a useful tool corresponding to similar tools for other language ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Since I don&rsquo;t really use Node, I went to the meetup out of curiosity more than anything else. I will probably not attend again. There seemed a lot of enthusiasm though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby">Pittsburgh Ruby meetup</a> held a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/120200102">lightning talks session</a>.</p>

<p>Originally, I was not going to present anything, since I did not feel that I had anything exciting to quickly share (I have not been doing much Ruby programming lately at all other than <a href="/blog/2013/06/29/nil-non-determinism-exceptions">debugging my Octopress-generated blog</a>), and don&rsquo;t like talking just to talk.</p>

<p>But at the very last minute, just half an hour before the meeting, I noticed some developments in the world of <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> announced on Twitter by Jim Weirich, and I got excited enough that I decided to talk about his <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given"><code>rspec-given</code></a>, which was just released at version 3.0.0.</p>

<p>Because the topic of the featured presentation by <a href="http://idiotcoder.com/">Richard Ashkettle</a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>, I made sure to attend my first meeting of the newly revived <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript/">Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup</a>. (This was actually the third meeting of the revived Pittsburgh JavaScript group, but I hadn&rsquo;t been able to make it to the first two.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d met Richard earlier, a month ago at <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/report-on-the-second-pittsburgh-techfest-2013/">Pittsburgh TechFest</a>. He does not claim to be an expert at functional programming, but is enthusiastic about concepts and techniques that he can and does apply to improving software quality in many dimensions. Since I have been a functional programming enthusiast and practitioner for twenty years, I had these goals in attending his presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li>evaluate what Richard and others have done with, and think is important about,  functional programming</li>
<li>offer a few corrections, elaborations, suggestions as appropriate for the situation</li>
<li>gather information on how I may be able to effectively explain functional programming to those who are new to it</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/30/why-i-hate-calling-myself-pragmatic-but-do/">post on my personal blog about my being a &ldquo;pragmatist&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>I mention it here because few words are as controversial, I think, in the programming community, as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo;. I wanted to be on record as identifying myself as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; despite the negative connotations, because the entire mindset of this new programming blog is pragmatic.</p>

<p>For example, I will soon write about the realities of programming language choice, including why I used Java, despite its deficiencies, for a decade, and why it is not going away, and why I currently am an advocate of <em>Scala, one of the most ambitiously pragmatic languages</em> to have come along in my lifetime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned in my <a href="/blog/2013/06/24/introducing-this-new-programming-blog/">initial post for this blog</a> that I have had some problems with the software I use to generate my personal blog, <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, and was thinking of migrating to a different platform that might in some ways be more robust to such problems. I ended up not doing so, and I still stand by that decision, but I just yet again ran into a problem with Octopress.</p>

<p>Here I report on how I figured out the problem and begin a conversation about the nature of error handling and API design.</p>

I recently encountered a problem: auto-updating of apps failed with this terrible error message:</p>

<blockquote><p>Application cannot be installed in the default install location.</p></blockquote>


<p>Also, a lot of time and bandwidth was each time spent on re-downloading the app and then failing, with no way to gracefully recover.</p>

<p>If you search the Web for this unpleasant error message, you will see hundreds if not thousands of confused end users like me asking on various forums how to deal with this.</p>

<p>I feel pretty bad about this situation, both as a programmer and as an end user.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pghpython/">Pittsburgh Python User Group</a> had <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pghpython/events/120442102">another &ldquo;favorite module night&rdquo;</a>. I enjoy this format because I get to learn about what people find useful, so that I may perhaps use it myself!</p>

<h2>How I benefited in the past</h2>

<p>For example, <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/23/pittsburgh-python-meetup-i-gave-my-first-lightning-talk-ever-the-topic-was-scons/">one of these &ldquo;favorite module night&rdquo; sessions</a> was where I learned about Kenneth Reitz&rsquo;s <code>requests</code> library. Very often it is easy to not be aware of the rapidly changing ecology of very useful libraries in a programming language ecosystem outside of the official &ldquo;standard library&rdquo;, especially when using a language that is <em>not</em> one&rsquo;s primary working language. For example, Python has never been one of my primary working languages, so I&rsquo;m not as up to date on what all the best tools are to use. But just a couple of weeks ago, I had to do some work with Python, and <code>requests</code> came in very handy.</p>

<h2><a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a></h2>

<p>Josh Adelman opened the show-and-tell with a demo of <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>. This is a truly fantastic interactive environment for developing code while creating a full document for publication and sharing. He uses it not only for research but also for his students to use in his teaching.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used Mathematica, the concept is similar to that environment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also excited that IPython Notebook has been the direct inspiration for similar projects for other languages, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/Bridgewater/scala-notebook">Scala Notebook</a> for Scala in development.</p>

<p>Josh gave a link to this <a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/">cool blog that uses IPython Notebook</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://getsentry.com/welcome/">Sentry</a> and <a href="http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Raven</a></h2>

<p>Nick Sloan presented on Sentry, a service for collecting errors in your program and notifying you of them, and Raven, the official Python client for Sentry. Sentry is actually open source, so you could host it yourself, but paying for the hosted service provides conveniences.</p>

<p>Using Sentry is no more than using ordinary Python logging after calling a setup function. The ease of use made it sound like a winner.</p>

<h2><a href="http://docopt.org/">docopt</a></h2>

<p>Joe Esposito presented on <code>docopt</code>, a library for command line parsing. The interesting thing about it is that it implements an <em>external</em> domain-specific language for describing command lines: you write a usage message, as a string, and <code>docopt</code> parses it in order to deduce what the expectations and constraints are. This is a very ambitious approach, contrary to the usual internal API-based approaches, some of which are sophisticated and implement an <em>internal</em> domain-specific language.</p>

<p>Of course, Joe contrasted this library with one of the standard command line parsing libraries for Python, <code>argparse</code>, which is lower-level so that when you use it, the high-level end user usage is not as immediately readable.</p>

<p>There were a lot of good questions about <code>docopt</code> since it seemed magical. I&rsquo;ve decided to write more about all this in a separate blog post about command line parsers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hypothesis">hypothesis</a></h2>

<p>I gave a short 5-minute presentation on <code>hypothesis</code>, a library in development for doing property-based testing, inspired by QuickCheck and ScalaCheck. As I have done recently when giving a much longer <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/11/my-pittsburgh-scala-meetup-talk-on-property-based-testing-using-scalacheck/">talk on property-based testing using ScalaCheck</a>, I focused on motivating the use of property-based testing as an addition to example-based testing.</p>

<p>Materials for my lightning talk are <a href="https://github.com/franklinchen/lightning-talk-on-hypothesis">here</a>, and my few slides are below:</p>

<h2><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html"><code>itertools</code></a></h2>

<p>Tim Lesher talked about <code>itertools</code>, a very useful part of the standard library that provides support for efficient functional programming idioms. Part of the efficiency comes from the use of iterators in order to avoid constructing intermediate lists; this is a way of simulating the lazy sequences that are standard in languages such as ML, Haskell, Scala, and Clojure.</p>

<p>Tim noted that although <code>itertools</code> is powerful, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be stupid&rdquo;: don&rsquo;t write obscure-looking code with it just because you can.</p>

<p>Josh noted that the documentation for <code>itertools</code> is great, with recipes that show you not only how to do things, and also with code for the equivalent more complicated code that you would have to write if you didn&rsquo;t use <code>itertools</code>. I agree that the documentation for <code>itertools</code> is a model of high-quality documentation for a library. Check it out, and use it!</p>

<h2><a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html"><code>argparse</code></a></h2>

<p>Craig gave a little presentation on <code>argparse</code>, the aforementioned standard library for command line parsing. He noted it was ironic that he had prepared to speak on it before Joe independently decided to talk about <code>docopt</code>. (Actually, I like <code>argparse</code> and had considered talking about it before Craig submitted it already.)</p>

<p>One feature he uses from <code>argparse</code> is the ability to create mutually exclusive groups. There was a question of whether this is supported in <code>docopt</code>.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;ll write more about both <code>argparse</code> and <code>docopt</code> in a separate blog post.</p>

<h2><a href="http://doughellmann.com/python-standard-library-by-example">The Python Standard Library by Example</a></h2>

<p>Someone shared not a &ldquo;favorite module&rdquo;, but a favorite book, &ldquo;The Python Standard Library by Example&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m happy he did, because it is in fact an excellent reference for anyone using the Python standard library, with concrete examples that you can take and use. Too often, I have found that standard documentation is too terse.</p>

<p>The book is based on <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/">&ldquo;Python Module of the Week&rdquo;</a>, which is a great online resource.</p>

<h2>Introductions for new people</h2>

<p>An important part of the vibe of the Pittsburgh Python User Group is how it tries to get everyone actively involved in the local Python community.</p>

<p>There is a tradition of periodically having everyone introduce themselves, to counter the tendency sometimes in these kinds of groups for people to attend a meeting out of curiosity and then silently leave and perhaps not come back, out of intimidation or not knowing how to benefit or contribute. I know I have done that before, especially when attending the meeting of a group where I didn&rsquo;t really know anybody ahead of time and still knew very little about the topics discussed by the group (such as when I joined the Pittsburgh Ruby group as one who had barely used any Ruby).</p>

<p>Since so many people showed up, and a lot seemed to be new faces, we had a round of introductions. I hope we&rsquo;ll continue to see some of these new faces in the future!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks again to Google Pittsburgh for hosting the Pittsburgh Python User Group meeting, and Steve Gross of Google for being the guy who makes it able for us to meet there!</p>
