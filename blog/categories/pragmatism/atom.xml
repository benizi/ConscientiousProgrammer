    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/30/why-i-hate-calling-myself-pragmatic-but-do/">post on my personal blog about my being a &ldquo;pragmatist&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>I mention it here because few words are as controversial, I think, in the programming community, as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo;. I wanted to be on record as identifying myself as &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; despite the negative connotations, because the entire mindset of this new programming blog is pragmatic.</p>

<p>For example, I will soon write about the realities of programming language choice, including why I used Java, despite its deficiencies, for a decade, and why it is not going away, and why I currently am an advocate of <em>Scala, one of the most ambitiously pragmatic languages</em> to have come along in my lifetime.</p>
