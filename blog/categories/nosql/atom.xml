<p>I finally finished a two-month <a href="http://education.mongodb.com/">free online course on MongoDB</a>, given by <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB, Inc</a>.</p>

<p>This is a review of the specific course numbered M101J, &ldquo;MongoDB for Java Developers&rdquo;, but it should apply to all thee introductory developer courses on MongoDB in any language, because actually, I had originally signed up months earlier for their original course (in JavaScript), and the content is largely the same (I had gotten busy and dropped that course).</p>

<h2>Why learn MongoDB?</h2>

<p>I had first heard of MongoDB over two years ago, at a meeting of the (now defunct) <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/">original Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup group</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/events/25229441/">&ldquo;In-depth look at Node.js and NoSQL&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>MongoDB has become very popular; as far as I can tell, this is because of extreme marketing efforts, as well as the fact that it is very easy to get started doing stuff with it, being a document-oriented NoSQL database requiring no schema.</p>

<p>I took this course in part to expose myself to some NoSQL technology and also in part because I anticipated needing to use something like it. In fact, it turns out <a href="/blog/2013/08/02/pittsburgh-ruby-python-social/">I did use it</a>, heavily, in exactly the kind of use case that works fine with it.</p>

<h2>Why did I take the Java version of the course?</h2>

<p>I took the &ldquo;M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers&rdquo; version of the course because I anticipated writing code in Scala to access MongoDB. In fact, during the course, I ended up using the official Scala driver <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/casbah">Casbah</a> when possible.</p>

<h2>Summary of the course</h2>

<p>A lot of the course actually involved using the JavaScript-based MongoDB shell, which makes sense because it is easy to explore data that way. Since everything is JSON-like, there&rsquo;s no real escaping JavaScript if you&rsquo;re working with MongoDB.</p>

<p>The video lecture/quiz/assignment format is fairly standard for MOOCs, and worked fairly well.</p>

<p>The course was more work than I expected, because it lasted so long, two months.</p>

<p>The ad hoc nature of MongoDB&rsquo;s API (including the Java-based one) tended to bother me throughout.</p>

<p>The weird CRUD syntax, shoehorning everything into a JSON representation, took some getting used to.</p>

<p>The way to specify indexes and to evaluate your guesses about whether they are actually working the way you expected was to look at funny values in JSON. I found this low-level and annoying.</p>

<p>The aggregation API seemed even weirder. Overall, everything had a loose &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; feel to it: this is the essence of MongoDB, really. Doing things wrong made me frustrated because of the runtime errors.</p>

<p>Finally, the sections on replication and sharding were particularly problematic. The lectures kept mentioning that various defaults and APIs were a moving target. Furthermore, actual hardcoded numbers even showed up that we were supposed to use to specify policies. Wow.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The lectures and quizzes were well-designed (until the final portion of the course that seemed particularly ad hoc). The assignments were sometimes rather tricky, with not much of a hint, but offered a decent variety of realistic query formation.</p>

<p>I would recommend this course as an overview to anyone who is committed to using MongoDB to its full extent.</p>

<p>However, although I got my &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; for completing the course, and appreciate that MongoDB, Inc offers this training for free, I felt that there was a lot of ad hoc stuff going on in the evolving design of MongoDB, and embedded in the API design as well. For what I needed to know for my work, I didn&rsquo;t really need the whole course.</p>
