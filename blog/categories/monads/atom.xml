    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Rich Hickey published a blog post, <a href="http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming">&ldquo;Transducers are Coming&rdquo;</a>, which attracted a lot of attention.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make, which I have made before: I find it very difficult to understand ideas or code not presented with <em>types</em>. So I decided that the only way I could possibly understand what &ldquo;transducers&rdquo; are would be to actually implement them in a typed language. I ended up doing so and am sharing my findings here.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Vague types in the original blog post</h2>

<p>Rich informally gave some type signatures in his blog post:</p>

<pre><code class="text">;;reducing function signature
whatever, input -&gt; whatever

;;transducer signature
(whatever, input -&gt; whatever) -&gt; (whatever, input -&gt; whatever)
</code></pre>

<p>This was, unfortunately, not very helpful. It is hard to make sense of this pseudo-notation for types. What is quantified over what? And what is bound to what? I&rsquo;ll explain later what I mean by these questions.</p>

<h2>First discussion thread I saw</h2>

<p>There was much tweeting online about transducers after Rich Hickey&rsquo;s initial announcement; the tweets did not help me, except for links posted to discussion elsewhere.</p>

<p>One of them was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8143905">on Hacker News</a>. I browsed through it but found it mostly not useful. The problem was that although a lot of interesting Haskell code was thrown around, it tended to be <em>related</em> to transducers but not an <em>exact</em> translation of the concept. I already had my own intuitions about transducers being related to well-known types such as <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Foldable_and_Traversable">foldables</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteratee">iteratees</a>, <a href="https://lens.github.io/">lenses</a>, etc. That &ldquo;ordinary function composition&rdquo; was involved immediately suggested the connections, because function composition is huge in these existing Haskell libraries.</p>

<p>But what I wanted was to understand transducers <em>as they are</em>, before even thinking about generalizations and comparisons.</p>

<h3>What are the types?</h3>

<p>Rich Hickey <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8144385">informally offered some types</a> (which he said were &ldquo;a la Haskell&rdquo;) to try to help out:</p>

<pre><code class="text">    ;;reducing fn
    x-&gt;a-&gt;x

    ;;transducer fn
    (x-&gt;a-&gt;x)-&gt;(x-&gt;b-&gt;x)
</code></pre>

<p>OK, by using type variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>x</code>, that indicates what is bound to what. The blog post should have used this notation rather than</p>

<pre><code class="text">;;transducer signature
(whatever, input -&gt; whatever) -&gt; (whatever, input -&gt; whatever)
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Clojure code</h3>

<p>He also posted some sample Clojure code:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/b5aefa622180681e1c81.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>(require &#39;[clojure.core.async :as a])

(def xform (comp (map inc)
              (filter even?)
              (dedupe)
              (flatmap range)
              (partition-all 3)
              (partition-by #(&lt; (apply + %) 7))
              (flatmap flatten)
              (random-sample 1.0)
              (take-nth 1)
              (keep #(when (odd? %) (* % %)))
              (keep-indexed #(when (even? %1) (* %1 %2)))
              (replace {2 &quot;two&quot; 6 &quot;six&quot; 18 &quot;eighteen&quot;})
              (take 11)
              (take-while #(not= 300 %))
              (drop 1)
              (drop-while string?)
              (remove string?)))

(def data (vec (interleave (range 18) (range 20))))

;; lazily transform the data
(sequence xform data)
;; reduce with a transformation (no laziness)
(transduce xform + 0 data)
;;build one collection from a transformation of another, again no laziness
(into [] xform data)
;;create a recipe for a transformation, which can be subsequently sequenced, iterated or reduced
(iteration xform data)
;;transform everything that goes through a channel - same transducer stack!
(let [c (a/chan 1 xform)]
  (a/thread (a/onto-chan c data))
  (a/&lt;!! (a/into [] c)))</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<h2>Second discussion thread I saw</h2>

<p>Then today, I saw a discussion thread on Reddit, titled <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2cv6l4/clojures_transducers_are_perverse_lenses/">&ldquo;Clojure&rsquo;s Transducers are Perverse Lenses&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h3>Actual runnable Haskell code</h3>

<p>Rich finally posted some actual <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2cv6l4/clojures_transducers_are_perverse_lenses/">type-checked, runnable Haskell code</a>!</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- Transducers in Haskell

mapping :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (r -&gt; b -&gt; r) -&gt; (r -&gt; a -&gt; r)
-- Original was (b -&gt; a) -&gt; (r -&gt; a -&gt; r) -&gt; (r -&gt; b -&gt; r)
-- but Michael O'Keefe in comment pointed out this is misleading
mapping f xf r a = xf r (f a)

filtering :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; (r -&gt; a -&gt; r) -&gt; (r -&gt; a -&gt; r)
filtering p xf r a = if p a then xf r a else r

flatmapping :: (a -&gt; [b]) -&gt; (r -&gt; b -&gt; r) -&gt; (r -&gt; a -&gt; r)
flatmapping f xf r a = foldl xf r (f a)

-- for exposition only, yes, conj is gross for lazy lists
-- in Clojure conj and left folds dominate
conj xs x = xs ++ [x]
xlist xf = foldl (xf conj) []

-- build any old list function with its transducer, all the same way
xmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
xmap f = xlist $ mapping f 

xfilter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
xfilter p = xlist $ filtering p

xflatmap :: (a -&gt; [b]) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
xflatmap f = xlist $ flatmapping f

-- again, not interesting for lists, but the same transform 
-- can be put to use wherever there's a step fn

xform :: (r -&gt; Integer -&gt; r) -&gt; (r -&gt; Integer -&gt; r)
xform = mapping (+ 1) . filtering even . flatmapping (\x -&gt; [0 .. x])


print $ xlist xform [1..5]
-- [0,1,2,0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
</code></pre>

<p>After this post, I knew it would not take me long to figure out transducers.</p>

<h2>Refactoring his Haskell code</h2>

<p>Two things to notice about the original code:</p>

<ul>
<li>It has long, low-level function types rather than types that actually <em>name</em> the concepts being discussed (<em>reducers</em> and <em>transducers</em>).</li>
<li>It uses hardcoded list types <code>[a]</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Type synonyms and higher-rank types</h3>

<p>Defining lots and lots of types (whether synonyms or <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Newtype">newtypes</a> is standard practice when programming in a modern typed language. OK, so I defined a type synonym</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- Left reduce
type Reducer a r = r -&gt; a -&gt; r
</code></pre>

<p>But what about transducer? This is trickier.</p>

<p>An <em>invalid</em> attempt at a type would be</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- Illegal!
type Transducer a b = Reducer a r -&gt; Reducer b r
</code></pre>

<p>because the type variable <code>r</code> is not bound in the type definition. And it would be incorrect to just randomly add <code>r</code> on the left hand side as an extra parameter to the <code>Transducer</code> type, because in fact it is <em>critical</em> that a transducer <em>does not care</em> about the underlying reducer&rsquo;s return type <code>r</code>. How do we write the desired type?</p>

<p>It turns out you need <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Rank-N_types">higher-rank types</a>. Rank-1 types are not sufficient; we need a rank-2 type to quantify <code>r</code>, to say that a transducer from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> is a transformation that takes a reducer to a specific <code>r</code> and returns another reducer to the <em>same</em> <code>r</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- Here's where the rank-2 type is needed
type Transducer a b = forall r . Reducer a r -&gt; Reducer b r
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can see more clearly some <em>completely generic</em> ways to create a transducer:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">mapping :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Transducer b a
mapping f xf r a = xf r (f a)

filtering :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Transducer a a
filtering p xf r a = if p a then xf r a else r
</code></pre>

<h4>A bit of history</h4>

<p>Higher-rank types are a powerful technique for expressing &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; of unnecessary details about types going on somewhere. My first recollection of the real world use of rank-2 types is from 1994 (the year I started using Haskell, although I did not actually use it in my work as a software engineer until 1995), when I was excited to read a paper by John Launchbury and Simon Peyton Jones that solved, using a rank-2 type, a specific, important, practical problem, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.50.3299">&ldquo;Lazy Functional State Threads&rdquo;</a>; twenty years later, their <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-ST.html">ST monad</a> is still part of the standard library!</p>

<h3>Introducing type classes</h3>

<p>Clojure uses <a href="http://clojure.org/protocols">protocols</a> as an abstraction mechanism, and the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; of transducers uses protocols. In Haskell, type classes are the major abstraction mechanism (this is true of Scala also).</p>

<p>So I abstracted away from the hardcoded list-oriented functions and values in Rich Hickey&rsquo;s Haskell code:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>foldl</code> abstracted to a <code>class Foldable</code></li>
<li><code>conj</code> and empty list <code>[]</code> abstracted to a <code>class Conjable</code></li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="haskell">-- Left fold
class Foldable f where
  fold :: Transducer a (f a)

class Conjable f where
  empty :: f a
  conj :: Reducer a (f a)
</code></pre>

<p>Note our reliance on transducing and reducing from one type <code>a</code> to another, <code>f a</code>.</p>

<h4><code>Foldable</code> constraint</h4>

<p>Unlike <code>mapping</code> and <code>filtering</code>, <code>flatmapping</code> is <em>not completely generic</em>, because it depends on something being <code>Foldable</code> (implementing a <code>fold</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">flatmapping :: Foldable f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; Transducer b a
flatmapping f xf r a = fold xf r (f a)
</code></pre>

<h4><code>Conjable</code> constraint</h4>

<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s the originally list-specific code that now depends only on <code>Foldable</code> and <code>Conjable</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- I changed Rich Hickey's code to be more general than just list
-- but accept anything Conjable
xlist :: (Foldable f, Conjable f) =&gt; Transducer b a -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
xlist xf = fold (xf conj) empty

-- build any old Foldable function with its transducer, all the same way
xmap :: (Foldable f, Conjable f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
xmap f = xlist $ mapping f 

xfilter :: (Foldable f, Conjable f) =&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; f a -&gt; f a
xfilter p = xlist $ filtering p

xflatmap :: (Foldable f, Conjable f) =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
xflatmap f = xlist $ flatmapping f
</code></pre>

<h3>List-specific stuff</h3>

<p>Here is the list-specific code:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- Stuff specialized to lists.
-- To use another type, just make it a Foldable and Conjable.
instance Foldable [] where
  fold = foldl

-- for exposition only, yes, conj is gross for lazy lists
-- in Clojure conj and left folds dominate
instance Conjable [] where
  empty = []
  conj xs x = xs ++ [x]

-- Note: the type does not say anything about Foldable or Conjable,
-- even though the implementation just happens to use a list!
xform :: Transducer Integer Integer
xform = mapping (+ 1) . filtering even . flatmapping (\x -&gt; [0 .. x])

-- Again, this can munge anything Foldable and Conjable, not just a list.
munge :: (Foldable f, Conjable f) =&gt; f Integer -&gt; f Integer
munge = xlist xform
</code></pre>

<p>Notice some very important properties of this code:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>xform</code> has a type that does not mention lists at all, even though it is implemented using a list and cannot compile without the list <code>instance</code> implementations.</li>
<li><code>munge</code> also does not mention lists, and can transform anything that is <code>Foldable</code> and <code>Conjable</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- munge a list
-- [0,1,2,0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
example1 :: [Integer]
example1 = munge [1..5]
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementing another type to illustrate the genericity of transducers</h3>

<p>To illustrate Rich Hickey&rsquo;s main point, I implemented instances of <code>Foldable</code> and <code>Conjable</code> for a standard Haskell <code>Vector</code> library as an alternate &ldquo;collection-like&rdquo; type.</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- For example using Vector instead of list
import qualified Data.Vector as V

-- Implement Foldable, Conjable type classes for Vector
instance Foldable V.Vector where
  fold = V.foldl

instance Conjable V.Vector where
  empty = V.empty
  conj = V.snoc
</code></pre>

<p>And we can run <code>munge</code> directly on a vector instead of a list, <em>without making any changes</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">-- return a vector rather than a list; note the fact that munge actually
-- internally uses a list
example2 :: V.Vector Integer
example2 = munge $ V.enumFromN 1 5
</code></pre>

<p>This is <em>code reuse</em> at its best.</p>

<p>Note that there is nothing that ties transducers to any concrete &ldquo;collection&rdquo; type. We could write instances of <code>Foldable</code> and <code>Conjable</code> for some kind of &ldquo;channel&rdquo; abstraction, for example, and instantaneously be able to munge data coming from it and to another. In fact, this is already what is done in the real world, where Haskell and Scala are used in production at places like Facebook and Twitter to efficiently handle large amounts of data.</p>

<h2>My code repository</h2>

<p>My complete code is available <a href="https://github.com/FranklinChen/clojure-transducers-in-haskell">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was pretty exciting to see the announcement of the transducers library for Clojure, because it represents a level of abstraction that I think has not been expressed much in the world of dynamically typed languages, although the techniques are two decades old in the Haskell community in a statically typed setting. And I hope that I was able to convey the sheer elegance of Haskell as a way to express interesting types with practical ramifications for abstraction and pluggability.</p>

    <link href="http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/12/31/review-of-the-free-coursera-course-principles-of-reactive-programming/"/>

    <id>http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/12/31/review-of-the-free-coursera-course-principles-of-reactive-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At long last, I have officially completed the free Coursera course <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">&ldquo;Principles of Reactive Programming&rdquo;</a>, receiving my &ldquo;Statement of Accomplishment&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This was an intense course, a lot of work, actually, and made the last two month s of my life (November and December) challenging as I juggled many activities. But it was worth the effort. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has completed the introductory course <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">&ldquo;Principles of Functional Programming in Scala&rdquo;</a> (or has the equivalent background). (See my <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012-11-15-review-of-courseras-fall-2012-functional-programming-principles-in-scala/">review of that course as offered in fall of 2012</a>.)</p>

<p>I took this course along with a bunch of local friends who are also members of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/">Pittsburgh Scala Meetup</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What is &ldquo;Reactive&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Reactive&rdquo; is a fairly new buzzword, popularized recently by the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a> to urge consideration of four traits modern applications may need to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>responsive</li>
<li>scalable</li>
<li>resilient</li>
<li>event-driven</li>
</ul>


<h2>Instructors and topics</h2>

<p>Each instructor was responsible for covering a key technology.</p>

<h3>Martin Odersky</h3>

<p>Martin Oderksy, the inventor of Scala and instructor for the previously mentioned &ldquo;Principles of Functional Programming in Scala&rdquo; course, focused on covering more advanced usage of Scala.</p>

<p>He immediately introduced monads, which are key to many of the concepts and libraries used throughout this course. Scala&rsquo;s support for monads through the syntax of for-comprehensions is very helpful. He introduced the property-based testing framework <a href="http://www.scalacheck.org/">ScalaCheck</a> (which uses monads for generation of data), and the first assignment involved working with the framework. (By the way, I gave a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/11/my-pittsburgh-scala-meetup-talk-on-property-based-testing-using-scalacheck/">talk on property-based testing using ScalaCheck</a> eight months ago.)</p>

<p>Then he discussed modeling event simulation in Scala using mutable objects. I felt that this unit was not in the spirit of the others, because there was so much uncontrolled mutable state running around. My friends and I agreed that the assignment for this unit was burdensome and not really useful. I thought to myself, in fact, that I would never solve the problems in this way.</p>

<h3>Erik Meijer</h3>

<p>Erik Meijer is a very energetic and humorous speaker. I really enjoyed his lectures.</p>

<p>In his first unit, he introduced asynchronous programming using Scala&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html"><code>Future</code> monad (backed by a <code>Promise</code>)</a>, as well as the cool new <a href="https://github.com/scala/async">macro-based <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> library</a>, which greatly simplifies writing code. Our assignment, which was instructive and interesting, was to implement a baby version of Node.js in Scala, ha!</p>

<p>Then he introduced <a href="https://rxscala.github.io/"><code>RxScala</code></a>, a Scala adaptor for <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava"><code>RxJava</code></a>, which is a Java port of Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;reactive extensions&rdquo; <code>Rx</code> framework. I enjoyed this unit a lot, and appreciated the great documentation available (the &ldquo;marble diagrams&rdquo; are particularly useful). One nitpick I suppose I must have with his presentation is that I&rsquo;m not sure that, for a non-theory-oriented audience, the discussions of &ldquo;duality&rdquo; were necessary. The assignment was very practically-oriented, gathering data asynchronously and displaying it and allowing user interaction. It was enjoyable and showcased the power of using a framework like Rx.</p>

<h3>Roland Kuhn</h3>

<p>Roland Kuhn covered the most complex section of the course, introducing actors by means of the <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> framework.</p>

<p>The first assignment was fairly straightforward, on implemented a distributed binary tree with actors.</p>

<p>The second assignment I found quite difficult, and not only because it was crunch time at the end of December before holiday season! It was a distributed key-value store with multiple levels of possible failure. There is no way I would have successfully and correctly completed this assignment without the helpful discussions I found on the online Coursera forums. To really figure out what was going on required (for me) turning on logging in various places and writing a lot of tests using Akka&rsquo;s <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/testing.html"><code>TestKit</code></a>. I realized eventually that my code was ugly and not entirely clean and idiomatic, but it was definitely a worthwhile learning experience on a realistic problem to solve.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I learned quite a lot from this course. It is a very practical course on &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; programming. I felt after completing this course that I was ready to use the concepts and technologies covered in real problems. I am grateful to the instructors (who were active on the forums, by the way) for sharing their theoretical and practical knowledge as a free Coursera course.</p>

<p>Because the topic of the featured presentation by <a href="http://idiotcoder.com/">Richard Ashkettle</a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>, I made sure to attend my first meeting of the newly revived <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript/">Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup</a>. (This was actually the third meeting of the revived Pittsburgh JavaScript group, but I hadn&rsquo;t been able to make it to the first two.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d met Richard earlier, a month ago at <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/report-on-the-second-pittsburgh-techfest-2013/">Pittsburgh TechFest</a>. He does not claim to be an expert at functional programming, but is enthusiastic about concepts and techniques that he can and does apply to improving software quality in many dimensions. Since I have been a functional programming enthusiast and practitioner for twenty years, I had these goals in attending his presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li>evaluate what Richard and others have done with, and think is important about,  functional programming</li>
<li>offer a few corrections, elaborations, suggestions as appropriate for the situation</li>
<li>gather information on how I may be able to effectively explain functional programming to those who are new to it</li>
</ul>

<h2>History of the Pittsbugh JavaScript meetup group</h2>

<p>Two years ago, in 2011, I had attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers">first incarnation of the group</a> faithfully, attending several months of meetings before it disbanded when the founder left Pittsburgh. I learned quite a bit from those meetings.</p>

<p>Two years is a long time in the world of JavaScript. Looking back at <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/09/27/when-jquery-attacks/">one of my blog posts reporting on the old JavaScript meetup group</a>, I am amused by how anachronistic that feels to me today, as in my mention of <a href="http://sproutcore.com/">Sproutcore</a>, which I never hear about any more.</p>

<h2>Up front: my take on the secret of JavaScript</h2>

<p>Here are some observations (not novel) I have about JavaScript, to set the stage for further discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript is full of horrible, disgusting Bad Parts.</li>
<li>JavaScript has only one shiny Good Part: it has first-class functions.</li>
<li>People manage to get a lot of amazingly cool and important stuff done using JavaScript, so take it seriously.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Comments on Richard&rsquo;s presentation</h2>

<h3>Immutability and &ldquo;functional languages&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Richard talked about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutability</a> as being part of what &ldquo;functional programming&rdquo; is about.</p>

<p>Yes, it is, and in addition, common best practices in many programming languages these days argue for favoring immutability. I want to emphasize that you don&rsquo;t have to go full-blown into a specialized &ldquo;functional language&rdquo; in order to take advantage of immutability as desired: for example, this tip has long since been known as at least a &ldquo;design pattern&rdquo; in the <a href="/blog/2013/06/25/pittsburgh-java-user-group-building-and-evolving-a-java-api/">Java world</a>, in the <a href="http://www.harukizaemon.com/blog/2010/03/01/functional-programming-in-object-oriented-languages/">Ruby world</a>, and basically everywhere else.</p>

<p>Richard suggested that &ldquo;functional languages&rdquo; don&rsquo;t allow mutation. By my definition, this is <em>not</em> actually true.  I didn&rsquo;t raise an objection during the talk because I didn&rsquo;t want to sidetrack it, but here I have space to elaborate a little. I would argue (but that would have to be another blog post) that the cleanest, most intuitive and novice-accessible &ldquo;functional languages&rdquo;) are those in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML</a> family originally developed in the 1970s and lives on today&rsquo;s popular, industrial-strength dialects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">Standard ML</a>, <a href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, and <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>

<p><em>ML fully supports mutation</em>, through <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Standard_ML_Programming/Types#References">reference cells</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, because of notions like this, I&rsquo;ve been thinking that maybe it would be best if we all stopped using the term &ldquo;functional language&rdquo;, because it has sadly become misleading and ambiguous. In particular, people instantly think &ldquo;Haskell&rdquo; when they use the word &ldquo;functional language&rdquo;, when in fact Haskell is a very unusual, unique language (and ecosystem) among languages that one could call &ldquo;functional&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Expressions, functions, evaluation, and values</h3>

<p>As Richard put it, &ldquo;favor expressions evaluating to a value&rdquo;. The focus of functional programming is on <em>returning</em> a value, from an expression that includes function calls, rather than munging some mutable global state, or modifying state through a reference passed into a function as a parameter.</p>

<h3>Recursion vs. looping?</h3>

<p>Richard noted that one characteristic of functional programming is the use of recursion instead of looping. He gave examples of writing tail-recursive functions.</p>

<p>One nitpick (which again, I did not bring up during the talk): recursion and looping (as in through &ldquo;normal&rdquo; constructs such as <code>while</code> and <code>for</code>) are <em>not</em> actually opposed. I will write a blog post later about why conventional looping is best thought of as a derived construct built on top of recursion, and why it might be best to consider conventional looping to be a historical accident and mistake (but a very useful invention given the historical circumstances).</p>

<h4>Efficiency of recursion?</h4>

<p>Also, people brought up the topic of efficiency. I have learned over the years that for many people, the word &ldquo;recursion&rdquo; seems to immediately trigger the word &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;. Richard did a great job in mentioning that <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proper_tail_calls">EMCAScript 6 is going to have proper tail calls (also called tail call optimization)</a>, which will make tail recursion equivalent to ordinary looping in terms of space usage. This is <em>hugely important</em> news, of course. This mandate shows how serious JavaScript is about embracing functional programming.</p>

<h4>Recursion for parallelism</h4>

<p>But beyond the issue tail recursion, I felt I had to point out that recursive algorithms can offer actual <em>speedup</em>. The classic examples, of course, are the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl/alg-sequence.html#quicksort">parallel speedups of divide-and-conquer algorithms such as quicksort that use recursion</a>. If you expressed the algorithms by removing the recursion (with a hand-rolled stack as often taught in courses), you would destroy the inherent parallelism. So in the world of parallelism, you want your code to stay naturally recursive! As <a href="http://adambom.github.io/parallel.js/">parallel computing comes to JavaScript</a>, keep this in mind!</p>

<h3>Higher-order functions, first-class functions</h3>

<p>Richard: &ldquo;A function is an object&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really as simple as that. Functions can be created, stored, passed around. Functions can return other functions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, but I claim that this is JavaScript&rsquo;s one Good Part, its killer feature that surprisingly many languages don&rsquo;t have. And it&rsquo;s the one feature that is used <em>all the time</em>, not just in esoteric code. From the very beginning, JavaScript had first-class functions, to support callbacks for client code in Web browsers. and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> server-side code is nothing if not a whole bunch of <code>function (...)</code>. Without closures and first-class functions, JavaScript would have been completely useless. Thank goodness <a href="http://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/">Brendan Eich was inspired by the Scheme functional language</a>.</p>

<h4>No methods!</h4>

<p>JavaScript not only provides full-fledged functions, but ironically, its weirdest feature, the prototype-based inheritance instead of class-based inheritance, inadvertently has prevented &ldquo;interference&rdquo; from the conventional class-based object-oriented world, which is mostly based not on functions, but on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_%28computer_programming%29">methods</a> that interference with functions because they are meant to <em>replace</em> functions (since according to &ldquo;pure&rdquo; object-oriented thinking, functions are evil and computation should involve method calls on objects). <em>JavaScript does not (really) have methods</em>; it only simulates them, by storing bona fide closures into fields of (map) objects. For example, if you use <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a>, the following code illustrates how the building blocks of typical JavaScript programming involve creating lots of <code>function</code>s: <code>valueWillChange</code> and <code>valudDidChange</code> are just functions. They are not special things, &ldquo;methods&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">App.PersonView = Ember.View.extend({
  valueWillChange: function (obj, keyName, value) {
    this.changingFrom = value;
  }.observesBefore('content.value'),
  valueDidChange: function(obj, keyName, value) {
      // only run if updating a value already in the DOM
      if(this.get('state') === 'inDOM') {
          var color = value &gt; this.changingFrom ? 'green' : 'red';
          // logic
      }
  }.observes('content.value')
});
</code></pre>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Richard gave some standard examples of using higher-order functions such as <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> and <code>foreach</code> as provided in various popular JavaScript libraries such as <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>.</p>

<p>As a matter of style, he recommended against long, obscure one-liners that involve chaining. I agree. For readability and testability of pipelines, I have found that it is good to break things up into intermediate steps. (Just <a href="/blog/2013/06/26/pittsburgh-python-night-of-the-favorite-module/">recently</a>, Tim Lesher also recommended against stupidity masking as excessive cleverness in his Python lightning talk about functional programming with <code>itertools</code>.)</p>

<h3>Monads?!</h3>

<p>Regrettably, Richard brought up the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29">&ldquo;monads&rdquo;</a>. I&rsquo;m close to thinking that this word should be <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/why-i-wont-be-writing-a-monad-tutorial/">banned</a>, because too many confusions about them have ruined the word. I have yet decided what the best alternative phrase might be. Maybe something like &ldquo;computational context&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Ironically, Richard admitted he was going to abuse the word, and for the sake of example, he said, he was going to say that &ldquo;jQuery is a monad&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want to derail his talk, and since he admitted the abuse, I decided there would be a better time to address this topic.</p>

<p>It was interesting to me, however, that he gathered that the interesting thing about jQuery, and why he wanted to call it a monad, was the chaining of calls in jQuery. I need to think of a good way to deal with this intuition when I get around to explaining monads.</p>

<h3>Partial application and currying</h3>

<p>Richard explained both partial application and currying, then he wondered when one would in practice write a curried function.</p>

<p>I said (but not very convincingly, I think) that you would write a curried function if you knew you would otherwise have to manually do a bunch of partial application. I have to confess that was a weak answer. I think the practical situation in JavaScript is that full-scale up-front currying is not useful.</p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>Richard recommended checking out the following libraries, especially Lo-Dash, which he judges to be faster than Underscore:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lodash.com/">Lo-Dash</a></li>
<li><a href="http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/">Functional JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<p>There were many interesting questions raised after the presentation.</p>

<h3>Introducing functional programming into a team environment</h3>

<p>Someone asked Richard a good question about whether it&rsquo;s appropriate to, say, start using Underscore at work and expecting other team members to learn how to use it. Is it fair to expect others to learn a new way of doing things that might seem weird?</p>

<p>My point of view is that there&rsquo;s nothing specific about functional programming when it comes to questions like this. The same question comes up when evaluating a particular programming language or a particular MVC framework or a particular version control system, and the answer involve considering all the different realities of who is comfortable with what, whether it is worth learning something new, what the advantages and disadvantages are, how much the decision will affect delivery of business value.</p>

<h3>Growing parameter list for a function vs. passing in a big object</h3>

<p>One concern brought up is that if you&rsquo;re programming in a functional style, you can end up being faced with ever-growing parameter lists for a function to pass in everything that it needs. One solution is to create a big object to stick everything into it that might be needed (for example, a configuration object instead of separate flag parameters). Is this overkill?</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://tonylukasavage.com/">Tony Lukasavage</a> emphasized that his concern was in the context of the need to evolve an existing API without breaking customers&#8217; client code that uses it.</p>

<p>My first note would be that API design is tricky and checking out <a href="/blog/2013/06/25/pittsburgh-java-user-group-building-and-evolving-a-java-api/">some resources on API design</a> is very helpful.</p>

<p>Regarding parameter lists, Richard noted that you might have a design problem if you have a function that needs to know about so many things it depends on. You may want to refactor the function (of course, in the context of evolving a mature API that customers depend on, it may be too late, unfortunately) and the data structures passed in. For example, if you have a number of functions that all take as parameters a <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>, then maybe you want a single <code>name</code> parameter instead.</p>

<p>I suggested also that if certain flags are not always needed, then instead of a huge configuration object, how about simply having separate but related functions (in a language supporting overloading, you could provide overloaded functions, although the topic of overloading is another large one to discuss later), each of which takes only the flags the client cares about. Of course, as some people pointed out, then you might end up with annoyingly long and specific function names.</p>

<p>Nobody said designing an API is easy.</p>

<h3>Do I actually do functional programming?</h3>

<p>One question I got, since before the meetup, I had indicated having experience with functional programming, was basically, do I actually use it in JavaScript and elsewhere. The answer is, yes. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, you don&rsquo;t have use a special language in order to program in this way, although it&rsquo;s much easier and more efficient to use a language that is tailored to support it. Most of the code I&rsquo;ve written in the past fifteen years has attempted to be primarily functional in style, whatever language I&rsquo;m using for work (mostly Java, Perl, Python, and recently Scala). I don&rsquo;t do this out of some kind of ideology, but because it works well in getting stuff done. Before adopting a primarily functional style of programming, I spent years working in traditional imperative and object-oriented styles, and empirically, that was less pleasant.</p>

<h4>Do I do functional programming in JavaScript?</h4>

<p>I have not actually done any JavaScript programming for work since doing some UI prototyping two years ago. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll return to doing front end work, but meanwhile, I am interested in doing some Web browser stuff for personal projects, so I try to keep up to date on developments in the JavaScript world.</p>

<p>One thing that has been interesting that I need to check out is the rise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">functional reactive programming (FRP)</a> libraries for JavaScript, such as <a href="https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js">Bacon.js</a>. FRP was originally invented in the 1990s by Conal Elliott in the context of Haskell, but almost twenty years later, has finally spread well beyond that now to mainstream visibility and use. For example, Microsoft has thrown its weight behind <a href="http://rx.codeplex.com/">Reactive Extensions (Rx)</a>, which started out in the .NET world, but Microsoft then ported it to JavaScript, C/C++, Python, and Ruby.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I was happy to see interest in functional programming in the local JavaScript community. Richard gave an introductory talk on it that I thought was very useful as a starting point for those who are new to it. I made note of some omissions or inaccuracies in order to improve my thinking about how I can contribute in the future to improving people&rsquo;s understanding and application of functional programming principles.</p>
