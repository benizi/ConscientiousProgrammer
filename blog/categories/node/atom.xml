    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://www.mongodb.com/sites/all/themes/bonsai/logo.png">http://www.mongodb.com/sites/all/themes/bonsai/logo.png</a>&#8221; title=&#8221;MongoDB logo&#8221; ></p>

<p>I finally finished a two-month <a href="http://education.mongodb.com/">free online course on MongoDB</a>, given by <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB, Inc</a>.</p>

<p>This is a review of the specific course numbered M101J, &ldquo;MongoDB for Java Developers&rdquo;, but it should apply to all thee introductory developer courses on MongoDB in any language, because actually, I had originally signed up months earlier for their original course (in JavaScript), and the content is largely the same (I had gotten busy and dropped that course).</p>

<h2>Why learn MongoDB?</h2>

<p>I had first heard of MongoDB over two years ago, at a meeting of the (now defunct) <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/">original Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup group</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/events/25229441/">&ldquo;In-depth look at Node.js and NoSQL&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>MongoDB has become very popular; as far as I can tell, this is because of extreme marketing efforts, as well as the fact that it is very easy to get started doing stuff with it, being a document-oriented NoSQL database requiring no schema.</p>

<p>I took this course in part to expose myself to some NoSQL technology and also in part because I anticipated needing to use something like it. In fact, it turns out <a href="/blog/2013/08/02/pittsburgh-ruby-python-social/">I did use it</a>, heavily, in exactly the kind of use case that works fine with it.</p>

<h2>Why did I take the Java version of the course?</h2>

<p>I took the &ldquo;M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers&rdquo; version of the course because I anticipated writing code in Scala to access MongoDB. In fact, during the course, I ended up using the official Scala driver <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/casbah">Casbah</a> when possible.</p>

<h2>Summary of the course</h2>

<p>A lot of the course actually involved using the JavaScript-based MongoDB shell, which makes sense because it is easy to explore data that way. Since everything is JSON-like, there&rsquo;s no real escaping JavaScript if you&rsquo;re working with MongoDB.</p>

<p>The video lecture/quiz/assignment format is fairly standard for MOOCs, and worked fairly well.</p>

<p>The course was more work than I expected, because it lasted so long, two months.</p>

<p>The ad hoc nature of MongoDB&rsquo;s API (including the Java-based one) tended to bother me throughout.</p>

<p>The weird CRUD syntax, shoehorning everything into a JSON representation, took some getting used to.</p>

<p>The way to specify indexes and to evaluate your guesses about whether they are actually working the way you expected was to look at funny values in JSON. I found this low-level and annoying.</p>

<p>The aggregation API seemed even weirder. Overall, everything had a loose &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; feel to it: this is the essence of MongoDB, really. Doing things wrong made me frustrated because of the runtime errors.</p>

<p>Finally, the sections on replication and sharding were particularly problematic. The lectures kept mentioning that various defaults and APIs were a moving target. Furthermore, actual hardcoded numbers even showed up that we were supposed to use to specify policies. Wow.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The lectures and quizzes were well-designed (until the final portion of the course that seemed particularly ad hoc). The assignments were sometimes rather tricky, with not much of a hint, but offered a decent variety of realistic query formation.</p>

<p>I would recommend this course as an overview to anyone who is committed to using MongoDB to its full extent.</p>

<p>However, although I got my &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; for completing the course, and appreciate that MongoDB, Inc offers this training for free, I felt that there was a lot of ad hoc stuff going on in the evolving design of MongoDB, and embedded in the API design as well. For what I needed to know for my work, I didn&rsquo;t really need the whole course.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> developer. I&rsquo;ve only used Node to play around with JavaScript, not for any real work or personal projects (yet). The last time I used Node was two months ago, for a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/pittsburgh-tech-fest-2013-my-talk-stop-overusing-regular-expressions/">talk I gave at Pittsburgh TechFest 2013</a> in which I wrote JavaScript code running on Node, but did not actually talk about it, and only mentioned that I had written it and put it up on my <a href="https://github.com/franklinchen/talk-on-overusing-regular-expressions">GitHub repository for the talk</a>.</p>

<p>That is why it took me so long to attend my first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/">Pittsburgh Node</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/events/128439692/">meeting</a>. I was simply curious who was involved in the local Node community and what tooling they were using. The meeting was about <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, a Make-like task runner. Nate Good of ShowClix presented.</p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>There was a fairly large group of people who attended: around thirty. Node seems to be popular in town.</p>

<h2>The talk</h2>

<p>Overall, Grunt seemed like Make or Rake. You can use plugins and define your own tasks. So there seemed nothing special about it, other than it is a useful tool corresponding to similar tools for other language ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Since I don&rsquo;t really use Node, I went to the meetup out of curiosity more than anything else. I will probably not attend again. There seemed a lot of enthusiasm though.</p>
