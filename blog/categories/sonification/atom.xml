    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/202086812">a fine meeting</a> of <a href="http://www.codeandsupply.co/">Pittsburgh Code and Supply</a> dedicated to two related topics: <em>music</em> and <em>sonification</em>. I thought it was a great idea to have presentations on both topics in the same session, thereby giving a broad view of what can be done with <em>sound</em> through computation.</p>

<h2>Erik Swanson on Overtone in Clojure</h2>

<p><a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a> is a very interesting environment for programmable music written in Clojure that I&rsquo;d heard of years ago but never gotten around to playing with, simply because my primary interest in music is <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/categories/music/">playing music on traditional physical instruments with my own hands, the old-fashioned way</a>. However, I am definitely open to the idea of doing interesting new things with computer aid; it just has not been a priority to explore.</p>

<p>As preparation for the presentation (I don&rsquo;t like feeling completely lost during live demos; I usually do!), I actually finally set up an Overtone project with Leiningen and walked through a tutorial that simply used the Clojure CIDER mode in Emacs to operate in a REPL. I didn&rsquo;t do any real live-coding, however. I just wanted to get a taste.</p>

<p>Erik Swanson gave a great presentation in which he described what he was doing as he live-coded some music with Emacs, incrementally creating instruments and generating pitches. Because of his presentation, I feel more comfortable about the prospect of really digging into Overtone if I ever want to.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of his presentation:</p>

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/keithcallenberg">Keith Callenberg</a> on conveying information through sound</h2>

<p>I learned a new word today: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification">&ldquo;sonification&rdquo;</a>, the use of non-speech audio to convey information.</p>

<p>I may have vaguely encountered sonification before, but never while fully attentive to it. That changed when Keith Callenberg, a computational scientist, gave a fine presentation in which he gave numerous striking examples of sonification. He made the important distinction between music and sonification: music is sound for an aesthetic purpose, but sonification is for information transfer.</p>

<p>He convincingly showed why sonification is useful for data analysis, and also noted that our culture is strangely dominated by the <em>visual</em>, so there remain many opportunities to use sound to understand data. (Also, sonification is used to help the visually impaired.)</p>

<p>One local example he gave was a particulate monitoring study done at CMU.</p>

<h2>David Souther on Web Audio in JavaScript</h2>

<p>I thought we were done for the evening, but David Souther hopped up with an unscheduled lightning talk on using Web Audio in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I enjoyed the presentations on music and sound, and got some ideas for stuff I might want to do myself. Another excellent session for Pittsburgh Code and Supply!</p>
