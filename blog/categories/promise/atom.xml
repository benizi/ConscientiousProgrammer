    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At long last, I have officially completed the free Coursera course <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">&ldquo;Principles of Reactive Programming&rdquo;</a>, receiving my &ldquo;Statement of Accomplishment&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This was an intense course, a lot of work, actually, and made the last two month s of my life (November and December) challenging as I juggled many activities. But it was worth the effort. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has completed the introductory course <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">&ldquo;Principles of Functional Programming in Scala&rdquo;</a> (or has the equivalent background). (See my <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012-11-15-review-of-courseras-fall-2012-functional-programming-principles-in-scala/">review of that course as offered in fall of 2012</a>.)</p>

<p>I took this course along with a bunch of local friends who are also members of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/">Pittsburgh Scala Meetup</a>.</p>

<h2>What is &ldquo;Reactive&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Reactive&rdquo; is a fairly new buzzword, popularized recently by the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a> to urge consideration of four traits modern applications may need to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>responsive</li>
<li>scalable</li>
<li>resilient</li>
<li>event-driven</li>
</ul>


<h2>Instructors and topics</h2>

<p>Each instructor was responsible for covering a key technology.</p>

<h3>Martin Odersky</h3>

<p>Martin Oderksy, the inventor of Scala and instructor for the previously mentioned &ldquo;Principles of Functional Programming in Scala&rdquo; course, focused on covering more advanced usage of Scala.</p>

<p>He immediately introduced monads, which are key to many of the concepts and libraries used throughout this course. Scala&rsquo;s support for monads through the syntax of for-comprehensions is very helpful. He introduced the property-based testing framework <a href="http://www.scalacheck.org/">ScalaCheck</a> (which uses monads for generation of data), and the first assignment involved working with the framework. (By the way, I gave a <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/11/my-pittsburgh-scala-meetup-talk-on-property-based-testing-using-scalacheck/">talk on property-based testing using ScalaCheck</a> eight months ago.)</p>

<p>Then he discussed modeling event simulation in Scala using mutable objects. I felt that this unit was not in the spirit of the others, because there was so much uncontrolled mutable state running around. My friends and I agreed that the assignment for this unit was burdensome and not really useful. I thought to myself, in fact, that I would never solve the problems in this way.</p>

<h3>Erik Meijer</h3>

<p>Erik Meijer is a very energetic and humorous speaker. I really enjoyed his lectures.</p>

<p>In his first unit, he introduced asynchronous programming using Scala&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html"><code>Future</code> monad (backed by a <code>Promise</code>)</a>, as well as the cool new <a href="https://github.com/scala/async">macro-based <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> library</a>, which greatly simplifies writing code. Our assignment, which was instructive and interesting, was to implement a baby version of Node.js in Scala, ha!</p>

<p>Then he introduced <a href="https://rxscala.github.io/"><code>RxScala</code></a>, a Scala adaptor for <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava"><code>RxJava</code></a>, which is a Java port of Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;reactive extensions&rdquo; <code>Rx</code> framework. I enjoyed this unit a lot, and appreciated the great documentation available (the &ldquo;marble diagrams&rdquo; are particularly useful). One nitpick I suppose I must have with his presentation is that I&rsquo;m not sure that, for a non-theory-oriented audience, the discussions of &ldquo;duality&rdquo; were necessary. The assignment was very practically-oriented, gathering data asynchronously and displaying it and allowing user interaction. It was enjoyable and showcased the power of using a framework like Rx.</p>

<h3>Roland Kuhn</h3>

<p>Roland Kuhn covered the most complex section of the course, introducing actors by means of the <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> framework.</p>

<p>The first assignment was fairly straightforward, on implemented a distributed binary tree with actors.</p>

<p>The second assignment I found quite difficult, and not only because it was crunch time at the end of December before holiday season! It was a distributed key-value store with multiple levels of possible failure. There is no way I would have successfully and correctly completed this assignment without the helpful discussions I found on the online Coursera forums. To really figure out what was going on required (for me) turning on logging in various places and writing a lot of tests using Akka&rsquo;s <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/testing.html"><code>TestKit</code></a>. I realized eventually that my code was ugly and not entirely clean and idiomatic, but it was definitely a worthwhile learning experience on a realistic problem to solve.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I learned quite a lot from this course. It is a very practical course on &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; programming. I felt after completing this course that I was ready to use the concepts and technologies covered in real problems. I am grateful to the instructors (who were active on the forums, by the way) for sharing their theoretical and practical knowledge as a free Coursera course.</p>
