    <h1>Report on my talk &#34;A gentle conceptual introduction to functional programming&#34;</h1>
    

<p>On behalf of the relatively new
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Functional-Programming-Meetup/">Pittsburgh Functional Programming</a>,
I gave an introductory talk held at Google Pittsburgh that I called
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Functional-Programming-Meetup/events/224593883/">&ldquo;A gentle conceptual introduction to functional programming&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>This presentation is part of an experiment, a big shift in how I&rsquo;m
trying to talk about not only &ldquo;functional programming&rdquo;, but any kind
of programming and more generally any topic at all (whether it&rsquo;s
cooking or music) for a wide audience. As I&rsquo;ve been doing more
teaching and collaboration in many areas of my life, I&rsquo;ve been trying
to figure out ways to better reach people. In particular, when
presenting something new, it&rsquo;s useful to motivate it and somehow
connect it to something they already know, even if it&rsquo;s different.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write more later about what I did differently in this talk than
I&rsquo;ve done in the past, and why. For now, I&rsquo;ll just say that one big
addition I made was that I prepared feedback forms to be filled out,
both to help me understand what I can do better and also to help
Pittsburgh Functional Programming plan further events and topics that
people want to see. So I will summarize the feedback I got (fifteen
participants filled out feedback forms).</p>

<h2 id="slides:d0bf3f7e5dfd4c4da1d64828408ba330">Slides</h2>

<p>For those who are curious about an outline of my talk, there are
<a href="https://github.com/FranklinChen/gentle-conceptual-intro-to-fp-for-humans/raw/master/presentation.pdf">slides</a>,
with the caveat that much of what I said or did are not on the
slides. In fact, one of the most commented-on helpful aspects of the
presentation was not on the slides at all: my use of a whiteboard. I
was happy I specifically requested that the venue provide me with a
whiteboard. I knew it was going to make a difference.</p>

<h2 id="comments-and-suggestions:d0bf3f7e5dfd4c4da1d64828408ba330">Comments and suggestions</h2>

<h3 id="logistics:d0bf3f7e5dfd4c4da1d64828408ba330">Logistics</h3>

<p>Some mentioned that I should have used a microphone. Point taken. This
is not the first time I&rsquo;ve forgotten to ask for a microphone. When
there&rsquo;s a large room and thirty people, even though I think I&rsquo;m
speaking loudly, it may not be loud enough.</p>

<h3 id="presentation:d0bf3f7e5dfd4c4da1d64828408ba330">Presentation</h3>

<p>I was happy that commenters felt I did a good job providing an
introduction that was not too elementary (I knew that there would be a
wide range of experience among those who attended). They also
appreciated my use of concrete <strong>examples</strong> and metaphors (such as the
pizza order).</p>

<p>My use of a <strong>whiteboard</strong> to draw pictures of immutable data structures
and step through the structural sharing that happens when you update
them was particularly well-received. I&rsquo;m convinced even more than ever
that helping with <strong>visualization</strong> and <strong>process</strong> is key.</p>

<p>My giving <strong>concrete</strong> pointers to libraries and other resources for
using FP in various languages (such as Python and JavaScript) was
noted. Just saying &ldquo;people are doing this, search for it&rdquo; is not
helpful.</p>

<p>A few quotes that made me feel I succeeded in my objectives, which
were to give an introduction that would open a world and inspire
further exploration:</p>

<blockquote>
I much better understand now the paradigm behind FP. So now I have a
reason to explore it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Thinking about immutable data in new way.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
It provided the foundation I was hoping for. I liked the data visualization.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
While I have encountered most of these topics before, the speaker did
an excellent job of giving a wide view of functional programming and
details beyond just the theory.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="some-things-people-are-interested-in-learning-and-using:d0bf3f7e5dfd4c4da1d64828408ba330">Some things people are interested in learning and using</h3>

<p>On the feedback form I requested suggestions for talk topics, hands-on
workshops, and study groups.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to use FP in a traditionally OO language</li>
<li>FP for practical tasks such as command-line and Web</li>
<li>FP design patterns</li>
<li>Concurrency in FP</li>
</ul>

<p>Languages people were interested in learning and using for FP (I list
those with at least two people writing them in):</p>

<ul>
<li>Haskell (4 responses)</li>
<li>Clojure (3 responses)</li>
<li>Elm (2 responses)</li>
<li>Scala (2 responses)</li>
<li>Python (2 responses)</li>
<li>JavaScript (2 responses)</li>
</ul>

<p>I should note that in the discussions, where not everyone submitted a
written feedback form, I gathered there was a lot of curiosity about
Elm.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion:d0bf3f7e5dfd4c4da1d64828408ba330">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t much of a report on the presentation, and I&rsquo;ll need to
write up details on our session, but I haven&rsquo;t been writing much at
all, so I thought this brief summary of the feedback is better than
nothing, in order to continue to move forward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very grateful for the hosting at Google Pittsburgh and all who
came out to attend my presentation and gave me such detailed feedback
in person or on paper.</p>
