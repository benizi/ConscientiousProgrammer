I am not a [Node](http://nodejs.org/) developer. I've only used Node to play around with JavaScript, not for any real work or personal projects (yet). The last time I used Node was two months ago, for a [talk I gave at Pittsburgh TechFest 2013](http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/pittsburgh-tech-fest-2013-my-talk-stop-overusing-regular-expressions/) in which I wrote JavaScript code running on Node, but did not actually talk about it, and only mentioned that I had written it and put it up on my [GitHub repository for the talk](https://github.com/franklinchen/talk-on-overusing-regular-expressions).

That is why it took me so long to attend my first [Pittsburgh Node](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/) [meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/events/128439692/). I was simply curious who was involved in the local Node community and what tooling they were using. The meeting was about [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), a Make-like task runner. Nate Good of ShowClix presented.

## Attendance

There was a fairly large group of people who attended: around thirty. Node seems to be popular in town.

## The talk

Overall, Grunt seemed like Make or Rake. You can use plugins and define your own tasks. So there seemed nothing special about it, other than it is a useful tool corresponding to similar tools for other language ecosystems.

## Conclusion

Since I don't really use Node, I went to the meetup out of curiosity more than anything else. I will probably not attend again. There seemed a lot of enthusiasm though.
