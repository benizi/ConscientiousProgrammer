title: "Aegis and Cook: what happens when an open source developer dies?"
---

By sheer accident, while I was looking for something else online, I
came across a Web site for [Aegis](http://aegis.sourceforge.net/), a
distributed version control system I used at work back in 1995-1997. I
was surprised this software was still alive after twenty years. A lot
of software has a very short life span, and since I had not heard
anything about Aegis all this time, I would have guessed that it had
died.

I remembered that we had used this software along with another tool
the author developed, called
[Cook](https://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/cook.README), which was a
replacement for
[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29). I was
unsuccessful in locating any official Web site for Cook, so I assume
it is more or less dead.

Meanwhile, I found by coincidence that actually, the author,
[Peter Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Miller_%28software_engineer%29),
died less than a year ago (July 2014). There was enough memory of him
that someone wrote that Wikipedia page on his contributions to open
source software. However, his Web site `http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/
`, sadly, has died with him, and with that, the site he had on Cook.

But we know that the Web is "forever", right? Let's see.

I found this old photo, for example.

## Wayback Machine

Basically, I checked the Wayback Machine, and it has some snapshots of
[his site](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/). The
last working snapshot was
[from 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20090111230031/http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/).

Here is his old
[software page](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327074944/http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/software/). Yes,
it includes a link to a Cook site, but it leads to a nonexistent
snapshot.

I stopped because I am not that interested in reliving the early
history of Cook. I never met the guy, although I believe I exchanged
email with him when it was just his personal project and he was "tech
support".

I wonder how historians fifty years from now will be working. So much
is no longer on paper, but stored in random archives on hard drives
somewhere.

## Conclusion

Software dies, people die. It was just weird for me to accidentally do
a bit of sleuthing to find more information about someone whose
software I once used a lot.

I haven't made a "will" for my code. I suppose I should have a plan in
place for whatever I value.

**Do you have a plan for your Web site or code or writings? Or do you
  expect them to disappear? How do you feel about leaving something
  behind?**
