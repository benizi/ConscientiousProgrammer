## Day 1

A couple of days ago, I happened to see a
[tweet from Ollie Charles](https://twitter.com/acid2/status/669882628695281669)
that he didn't have time to do his usual annual December "24 days of..."
Haskell blog posts this year (2015) and felt sad because I've
learned a huge amount from
[reading them](https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/). In both 2012 and 2013, he
wrote "24 days of Hackage", daily short and sweet blog posts that
showed how to use selected Haskell packages you can get from the
community archive [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/), and in 2014
he covered GHC language extensions.

With some trepidation, I decided that I would do a "24 days of
Hackage" series myself to cap off this year, to share a selection of
the huge number of Haskell packages I find useful. I thought it would
be particularly appropriate to do this given that 2015 was the year
that I migrated to *using Haskell as my main language* for most new work and
personal projects, and therefore this has been a year of considerable
discovery for me.

## All the code

All my code for my article series will be at
[this GitHub repo](https://github.com/FranklinChen/twenty-four-days2015-of-hackage).

## My selection criteria

How to choose what to cover? I like what Ollie wrote in his
[2012 inaugural post](https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2012-12-01-24-days-of-hackage.html):
"This will be a whirlwind tour of some modules that I use on an almost
daily basis, including modules that have inspired me, modules that
have changed the way I think about code, and some modules that are so
amazing Iâ€™m not even smart enough to use them!"

My own intention: some of what I'll cover is already popular and
well-known, some may be just minor but useful utilities, some may be
completely obscure, but the underlying theme will be "stuff I use and
can briefly say something useful about".

## Stack

It was a no-brainer to choose the first day's topic:
[Stack](http://haskellstack.org/), the main new thing for Haskell in
2015 other than [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) 7.10.

**Stack changed my (Haskell) life.**

Stack is a game changer for the Haskell community. It is an all-in-one
solution for creating Haskell projects, managing dependencies,
building, and more. Since Stack came out, I've been slowly migrating
old projects to use it, and I use Stack for all new projects,
including the
[repo for this article series](https://github.com/FranklinChen/twenty-four-days2015-of-hackage).

I'm not giving a full-blown tutorial on Stack here today, just a
little taste, and you can read the
[official documentation](http://haskellstack.org/) for details, but
what I want to emphasize is that Stack is useful not only for
experienced developers, but especially also for newcomers, so part of
today's article is geared specifically to newcomers (or those who
tried Haskell once and are interested in a fresh start with better
tooling).

## "How do I get started with Haskell"?

When I launched [Pittsburgh Haskell](http://pittsburghhaskell.org/)
in February this year (2015), I faced a huge hurdle: helping newcomers
to Haskell get started. I created an introductory workshop session,
but a huge number of people were discouraged by my best shot at
creating [a now-obsolete set of Haskell installation instructions](https://github.com/pittsburgh-haskell/haskell-installation) that would work for Mac OS,
Windows, and Linux, and people had major problems installing a basic
tool chain, and versioning issues if they already had an old version
of GHC installed. Too much time was wasted on trying to help people with
installation.

Pittsburgh Haskell happened to go on hiatus in April as I got busy
with many other things and there was no momentum at the time to keep
it going, but I believe one huge problem in trying to create a new
local Haskell community from newcomers was the tooling/setup
annoyance.

**Stack solves this problem.** If I gave an introductory Haskell workshop again, I would definitely use Stack.

## An example of getting started with Stack using a custom template

If you don't already use Stack,
[download it](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html#how-to-install).

The Stack Web site already has documentation on how to get started
with Stack using a default template. Here, I want to promote the idea
of using and sharing custom templates. This is not documented so well,
but I think will become more and more important for newcomers, and is
also of course useful for any of us who end up creating the same
boilerplate project setups.

### Using an official template

I've created a custom template called `franklinchen` that is part of
the official [`stack-templates`](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates)
repo.

If you run

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack new stack-template-demo franklinchen
{{< /highlight >}}

you will be prompted for information to create a new project called `stack-template-demo`.

### Using your own local template

Note that the template specified does *not* have to be in the official
`stack-templates` repo. It can also be on your local file system. For
example, before I submitted my template to `stack-templates`, I used
to run

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack new stack-template-demo /path/on/my/computer/to/franklinchen.hsfiles
{{< /highlight >}}

where `franklinchen.hsfiles` is my template (read below on creating
your own template).

(I've put up an instance of the generated project up
[on GitHub](https://github.com/FranklinChen/stack-template-demo) if
you want to look at its structure without installing and running Stack
right now.)

### Getting started with the newly generated project

Enter the project directory:

{{< highlight console >}}
$ cd stack-template-demo
{{< /highlight >}}

### Stack downloads GHC for you

Run

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack setup
{{< /highlight >}}

If you do not already have an appropriate version of GHC installed,
Stack will *automatically* download and install it for you, into an
area in Stack's configuration directory `~/.stack/`. The important
thing to note is that when using Stack, multiple versions of GHC can
coexist as desired for different build configurations and setups. This
feature is really important, because not everyone uses the same
version of GHC and you can build your project against multiple
versions of GHC easily.

This automatic-downloading feature is particularly useful for
newcomers who don't need to mess around with some kind of separate
global installation requiring special privileges.

The output, if Stack needs to download anything:

{{< highlight console >}}
Preparing to install GHC to an isolated location.
This will not interfere with any system-level installation.
Downloaded ghc-7.10.2.
Installed GHC.
stack will use a locally installed GHC
For more information on paths, see 'stack path' and 'stack exec env'
To use this GHC and packages outside of a project, consider using:
stack ghc, stack ghci, stack runghc, or stack exec
{{< /highlight >}}

### Launching the GHCi REPL

The most important thing for a newcomer to Haskell is to get started
with the GHCi REPL, so let's do that right away. Doing this within the
context of a project while preloading the modules of the project is
simple with Stack.

Run

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack ghci
{{< /highlight >}}

Note that **only the first time** you do this (or other commands that
require getting library dependencies), Stack may take a while to
download and build them. The dependencies will actually end up being
installed and cached such that *other projects* in the future that use
them can reuse them. This is a huge advantage of using Stack versus
the old days before Stack, when there was always an issue of
redownloading and recompiling the same libraries for different
projects; that was a tremendous time and space waster! Stack
intelligently figures out for you what can be shared consistently or
not.

Stack launches a GHCi REPL with our modules preloaded:

{{< highlight console >}}
Ok, modules loaded: Lib, Main.
{{< /highlight >}}

In `src/Lib.hs` of the sample project, we have a silly module
illustrating some [Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/)
documentation comments:

{{< highlight haskell >}}
-- | A library to do stuff.
module Lib
    (
      ourAdd
    ) where

-- | Add two 'Int' values.
ourAdd :: Int  -- ^ left
       -> Int  -- ^ right
       -> Int  -- ^ sum
ourAdd x y = x + y
{{< /highlight >}}

We can access the `Lib` module from the REPL:

{{< highlight console >}}
*Main> ourAdd 2 3
5
*Main> Lib.ourAdd 4 5
9
{{< /highlight >}}

We can also access `Main`, which is defined in `app/Main.hs`:

{{< highlight haskell >}}
module Main where

import Lib (ourAdd)

import Text.Printf (printf)

main :: IO ()
main = printf "2 + 3 = %d\n" (ourAdd 2 3)
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight console >}}
*Main> main
2 + 3 = 5
{{< /highlight >}}

### Building and running the project

You could have explicitly compiled the project first, before launching
the REPL. In practice in real projects, I start by compiling a project
to get the dependencies compiled, before I use GHCi, but the above
does it for you too:

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack build
{{< /highlight >}}

Because I defined a native-compiled binary executable named
`stack-template-demo` in our Cabal file `stack-template-demo.cabal`,
we can run the executable:

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack exec stack-template-demo
2 + 3 = 5
{{< /highlight >}}

I supplied unit tests for `Lib` in `test/LibSpec.hs` that can be run:

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack test
Lib
  Lib
    works
    ourAdd is commutative

Finished in 0.0007 seconds
2 examples, 0 failures
{{< /highlight >}}

### Installing the library and executable

You can now install the library and executable for your own use later:

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack install
...
...
Copying from /Users/chen/stack-template-demo/.stack-work/install/x86_64-osx/lts-3.16/7.10.2/bin/stack-template-demo to /Users/chen/.local/bin/stack-template-demo

Copied executables to /Users/chen/.local/bin:
- stack-template-demo
{{< /highlight >}}

For example (since `~/.local/bin` is in my `PATH`):

{{< highlight console >}}
$ stack-template-demo
2 + 3 = 5
{{< /highlight >}}

### Your own Stack template configuration

When using Stack templates, it's useful to set up a
configuration so that information can automatically be filled out for
you when you generate new projects. The documentation for
configuration is
[here](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/yaml_configuration.html). Create
a file in
`~/.stack/config.yaml`. Mine has:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
templates:
  params:
    author-email: "franklinchen@franklinchen.com"
    author-name: "Franklin Chen"
    category: test
    copyright: "2015"
    github-username: "FranklinChen"
{{< /highlight >}}

### Other bells and whistles

I try to use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for any public
code I put up, so my template generates a `.travis.yml` file that uses
Stack. I've started to migrate my former Travis setups based on
[`multi-ghc-travis`](https://github.com/hvr/multi-ghc-travis) to use
Stack instead.

## Creating a custom Stack project template

It was surprising to me that how to create a custom template is not
covered in the main Stack documentation. Instead, I found it at the
[`stack-templates`](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates)
site.

The method of creating a custom template is kind of clumsy, involving
creating a single file with embedded directives to indicate generated
file name and directory structure, but it's a start.

## Conclusion

For day 1 of my "24 days of Hackage, 2015", I've briefly introduced
how to use Stack, the Haskell tool that I'm using to build and run all
the sample code for this article series.

Next up: some real code!
