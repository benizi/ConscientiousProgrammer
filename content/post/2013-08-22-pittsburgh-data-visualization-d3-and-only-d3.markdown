Patrick gave a presentation for the [Pittsburgh Data Visualization Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Data-Visualization-Group/) on [only D3](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Data-Visualization-Group/events/135374702/), because there was interest after the [previous meetup](/blog/2013/08/07/pittsburgh-data-visualization-d3-and-r/) for more on D3.

## Summary

Patrick started with a review of last time, on selections, data, callbacks, and transitions.

Then he went into the use of [heat maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map).

Finally, he went into forces.

I have to confess that I got lost in the presentation because of the volume of code presented and my unfamiliarity with the API. I believe that I've reached the limit of what I can passively absorb about using D3, and simply need to get down and dirty and create my own project.

I was also feeling really tired and on the verge of getting sick. I felt very cold in the room and did not have a jacket on me in the summer.
