Last month at OpenHack Pittsburgh, I had a rather [social time](/blog/2014/01/27/openhack-pittsburgh-a-great-place-to-share-and-learn/).

[This month](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/163727212/), I kept entirely to myself. I didn't even speak up to say what I was working on. I was in a somber mood, and didn't really want to talk. I worked on a private project that I will share when I am ready.

It did feel consoling to be around other people, even while keeping to myself. Sometimes I just need to know that I am not alone.
