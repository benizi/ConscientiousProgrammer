      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/30/why-i-hate-calling-myself-pragmatic-but-do/&#34;&gt;post on my personal blog about my being a &amp;ldquo;pragmatist&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mention it here because few words are as controversial, I think, in the programming community, as &amp;ldquo;pragmatic&amp;rdquo;. I wanted to be on record as identifying myself as &amp;ldquo;pragmatic&amp;rdquo; despite the negative connotations, because the entire mindset of this new programming blog is pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I will soon write about the realities of programming language choice, including why I used Java, despite its deficiencies, for a decade, and why it is not going away, and why I currently am an advocate of &lt;em&gt;Scala, one of the most ambitiously pragmatic languages&lt;/em&gt; to have come along in my lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
