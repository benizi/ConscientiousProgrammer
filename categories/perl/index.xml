      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I went to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://openhack.github.io/pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;OpenHack Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; meeting. The last time was &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/25/openhack-pittsburgh-exploring-scala-odds-and-ends/&#34;&gt;five months ago&lt;/a&gt;. On June 24, there was an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/120200292/&#34;&gt;OpenHack Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; held at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4moms.com/&#34;&gt;4moms&lt;/a&gt;, but I really needed to stay home and take it easy that evening, because of my busy schedule later in the week, including attending a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/06/25/pittsburgh-java-user-group-building-and-evolving-a-java-api/&#34;&gt;PittJUG meeting&lt;/a&gt; and preparing a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/06/26/pittsburgh-python-night-of-the-favorite-module/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Python talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/120201842/&#34;&gt;This August meeting of OpenHack Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; was held at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.modcloth.com/&#34;&gt;ModCloth&lt;/a&gt;, which I had never been to. It&amp;rsquo;s in Crafton, which is a place I&amp;rsquo;ve never been before, nearly half an hour drive from Pittsburgh. Because of worries about driving there near rush hour after work, I probably would not have signed up to attend had it not been for &lt;a href=&#34;http://justinxreese.com/&#34;&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt;, the organizer of OpenHack Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened was that he asked for feedback about who was planning to work on what, and said he planned to learn some &lt;a href=&#34;http://elixir-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly new programming language built on top of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.erlang.org/&#34;&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt; runtime. Since this language had been on my list of things to look into, I decided that learning loves company, so I proposed to learn some Elixir in a test-driven way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-learn-a-programming-language:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;How to learn a programming language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written code in probably around fifty (50) programming languages. I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding, and I&amp;rsquo;m not proud, but this is simply a fact of my having done programming since 1982, thirty-one (31!!) years ago. Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: languages come and go. I have personally sat at an IBM &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch&#34;&gt;keypunch&lt;/a&gt; machine punching out cards for my COBOL and Fortran code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with human languages, the fact is that to be truly productive in a language requires much more than learning some syntax and semantics. It requires actually writing and running and fixing code, and in the context of a realistic project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned through trial and error that the most common ways of learning a programming language, like the most common ways of learning human languages (other than one&amp;rsquo;s first language), are terribly inefficient and misleading, resulting in minimal competence. I mean, reading through books, typing into a REPL, submitting a single file to a compiler or interpreter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that we should learn programming languages using a variety of approaches. Yes, the academic bottom-up semantics-based approach is critical in the long run, to avoid wasting a lot of time on pointless misunderstandings. Exploration in a REPL can be very rewarding. But I think what is often missing is the &lt;em&gt;biggest possible picture&lt;/em&gt;: immediately seeing how to write a program that is integrated with a test framework, uses libraries, is exportable and publishable publicly as a library, can be submitted to a continuous integration server, is editable in a decent editor or IDE, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without seeing the biggest possible picture, one usually gets a horribly inaccurate picture of what it is like to program in a particular language ecosystem. (I will be writing more about this subject of pedagogy later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-proposal:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;My proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last couple of languages I have learned in recent years, I slowly came to work with in a more efficient way than in the past, because I focused on matters such as testability. In particular, as I grew to wholly adopt TDD when writing any code at all in any language, it became clear to me that the best way to learn a new language must be in a test-driven way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an analogy: I believe the best way to learn a human language is to dive into how to be able to converse in some coherent way right off the bat. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fluentin3months.com/4-hour/&#34;&gt;Tim Ferriss and others&lt;/a&gt; have exploited this idea to &lt;em&gt;drive&lt;/em&gt; the learning of what is most relevant in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/&#34;&gt;grammar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/01/20/learning-language/&#34;&gt;vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I learned human languages in a terrible way, taking lots of courses, but never actually getting fluent in everyday use. This is how we tend to learn &amp;ldquo;foreign&amp;rdquo; programming languages. My proposal is that learning a new programming language should involve getting as quickly as possible up to speed on a &lt;em&gt;minimum viable publishable library&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the software artifact should be a &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt;, and not just some executable program, is vital, because it means having to adhere by whatever standards apply to real-world API design in the language ecosystem, producing something that client code can import and call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That it should be &lt;em&gt;publishable&lt;/em&gt; is vital because it means adhering to standards of testing, of discovery through metadata, and enabling easy use by a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-concrete-example-with-learning-elixir-tonight:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;My concrete example with learning Elixir tonight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prior-background-in-erlang-and-elixir:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;Prior background in Erlang and Elixir&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to OpenHack Pittsburgh &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; having yet read any Elixir language material, never having written Elixir code, not even &amp;ldquo;hello, world&amp;rdquo;. The only things I had done before tonight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first heard of Erlang nearly two decades ago, and when I saw it, I was turned off by the Prolog-style syntax, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem relevant to anything I was doing at the time, so I ignored it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I intended to learn some Erlang earlier this year, but made little progress before putting it aside: I went to the free book &lt;a href=&#34;http://learnyousomeerlang.com/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and downloaded the code and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FranklinChen/learn-you-some-erlang&#34;&gt;got it to compile&lt;/a&gt;, but did not proceed any further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I installed Elixir on my Mac &lt;a href=&#34;http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html&#34;&gt;using Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I installed an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/elixir-lang/emacs-elixir&#34;&gt;Emacs Elixir mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a note of a free online book &lt;a href=&#34;http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001642&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Etudes for Elixir&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and checked out the GitHub repository, but did not look at the book or code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-a-testing-framework:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;Find a testing framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival at ModCloth, getting pizza to eat, and plugging in my MacBook and connecting to the guest WiFi, the first thing I did was search for a testing framework for Elixir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 2013, not 1993, so it is hard to convince me to invest any time at all in learning to operate in a language ecosystem that does not have at least a de facto standard testing framework. For every language that I currently actively use for writing serious programs, I operate with TDD. Some examples of languages and the test frameworks I currently use for them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C/C++: &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/googletest/&#34;&gt;googletest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clojure: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marick/Midje&#34;&gt;Midje&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haskell: &lt;a href=&#34;http://hspec.github.io/&#34;&gt;HSpec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2&#34;&gt;QuickCheck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java or Scala: &lt;a href=&#34;http://specs2.org/&#34;&gt;Specs2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scalacheck.org/&#34;&gt;ScalaCheck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript: &lt;a href=&#34;http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/&#34;&gt;Jasmine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl: &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.cpan.org/~mschwern/Test-Simple-0.98/lib/Test/More.pm&#34;&gt;Test::More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python: &lt;a href=&#34;http://pytest.org/&#34;&gt;pytest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby: &lt;a href=&#34;http://rspec.info/&#34;&gt;RSpec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Racket: &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/&#34;&gt;RackUnit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, first Web search hit for Elixir and unit testing was &lt;a href=&#34;http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/ex_unit/1.html&#34;&gt;ExUnit&lt;/a&gt;, so that was encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin was still stuck installing Elixir, so we started exploring Elixir together off my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-test-file:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;One test file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did after discovering ExUnit was to copy and paste the code for a sample test into Emacs and save it into a file &lt;code&gt;test_hello.exs&lt;/code&gt;, see that the Elixir mode was working (with syntax highlighting), and figure out how to run the test: &lt;code&gt;$ elixir test_hello.exs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we explored adding more tests, changing some assertions, and learning as went, by looking up the Elixir documentation. For example, Elixir uses an interesting callback mechanism for cleanly passing &amp;ldquo;setup&amp;rdquo; state to tests inside a single test case. Also, &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_%28computer_science%29#Syntactic_macros&#34;&gt;syntactic macros&lt;/a&gt;, enabling them to do magic to analyze expressions, hence the support of natural assertion syntax (which &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/07/11/pittsburgh-ruby-lightning-talk-night/&#34;&gt;I like a lot better than special syntax&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing some failing tests involving arithmetic and making them pass, I wrote a division by zero test. I was intrigued that not only did it fail, as expected, but also the compiler warned ahead of time that an exception was going to be raised. Nice. In any case, I learned how to make an assertion of the raising of an exception. This is very important. We should always pay attention to &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/report-on-the-second-pittsburgh-techfest-2013/&#34;&gt;testing the sad paths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw in the documentation for ExUnit that there was a way to mark a test case as being OK to run concurrently with others. Great! These days there is no excuse not to be able to run tests concurrently. So I wrote another test case, which I put in the same source file (for the moment), and I wanted to see for myself that concurrency was happening. I wanted to call some kind of &amp;ldquo;sleep&amp;rdquo; function. To do that, I did a Web search, and found that Erlang comes with &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;timer&lt;/code&gt; module. I found out how to call Erlang from Elixir, and it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-than-one-source-file:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;More than one source file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next obvious step was to write a test for code that did not yet exist, but was to be written outside the test source file. For that, I had to figure out how to define a module and import it. OK, but then there&amp;rsquo;s the question of file organization. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the only reasonable thing to do (and which in retrospect should have been done first) was to find out what the &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; way of organizing a project&amp;rsquo;s source files is supposed to be, and what the standard way to build everything is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Web search quickly came up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix/1.html&#34;&gt;Mix&lt;/a&gt;. Awesome, the Elixir people are serious about real software development! Mix turns out to be inspired by Clojure&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen&#34;&gt;Leiningen&lt;/a&gt;, which of course I use to start any new Clojure project. &lt;code&gt;$ mix new hello&lt;/code&gt; did the trick, creating the scaffolding for a new Elixir project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refactored our existing &lt;code&gt;test_hello.exs&lt;/code&gt; file into two files (one for each test case) in the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; directory, then wrote a module &lt;code&gt;hello.ex&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt;. A failed test, then making it succeed, and finally I wrote my first non-test code in Elixir!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running tests is very easy once you are using Mix. Just &lt;code&gt;$ mix test&lt;/code&gt; does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;packaging-for-publshing:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;Packaging for publshing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I decided I wanted to create an actual Elixir package to publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did a Web search to find out whether there was a standard repository and how to publish to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go, &lt;a href=&#34;http://expm.co/&#34;&gt;Expm&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed the package manager, set up my user name and password, and went to work on a simple package to publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw that nobody had yet contributed an implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/14/for-real-geeks-today-is-not-pi-day-but-half-tau-day/&#34;&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt;, so I quickly created a tau library with Mix, did &lt;code&gt;$ expm new&lt;/code&gt; to create a &lt;code&gt;package.exs&lt;/code&gt; template, filled it out, wrote an ExUnit test that passed, completed the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, and just as OpenHack Pittsburgh was officially closing for the evening, I successfully published &lt;a href=&#34;http://expm.co/tau&#34;&gt;my tau package&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I accidentally screwed up the first time, forgetting to change all the fields of the template &lt;code&gt;package.exs&lt;/code&gt; and ending up published &lt;code&gt;yourlib&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I committed my project in Git and pushed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/franklinchen/tau&#34;&gt;to GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-haskell-stuff:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;Some Haskell stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve McCarthy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spacefinity.com/&#34;&gt;Spacefinity&lt;/a&gt; had announced, in the introduction at the beginning of the evening when each of us stood up to say what we planned to work on, that he wanted to do more with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/cabal/&#34;&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt; package manager for Haskell, so I spent a little bit of time getting him going by pointing him toward a sample Haskell code repository I initially &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/11/05/the-start-of-a-local-haskell-study-group.markdown/&#34;&gt;set up last year when some friends were interested in getting into Haskell&lt;/a&gt;; sadly, we&amp;rsquo;ve all been too busy for Haskell, so I&amp;rsquo;ve let the project rot, in the sense that my configuration file is not optimally organized and also there have been updates in the test framework world in Haskell since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FranklinChen/project-euler-haskell&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Project Euler in Haskell&amp;rdquo; repository&lt;/a&gt;. I plan to get around to improving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thanks:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to ModCloth for providing the space, pizza, cookies, and WiFi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank-you to Justin for providing the inspiration for me to try this experiment in learning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to Steve McCarthy for getting me to drag up an old Haskell project and making me think that I should soon update it to be a better example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight was the first time I ever started learning a new programming language, wrote unit tests right off the bat with proper project organization and also published a library immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is much more to go in actually really learning and using Elixir, but as a first step in showing that Elixir has a viable ecosystem, I think the experiment was a success. My next steps in continuing to learn Elixir would include writing tests in conjunction with a deep dive into the actual semantics of the language. There is no substitute for the latter; the alternative is dangerously making assumptions based on superficial syntactic similarity with other languages (such as Ruby).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-08-27:1ce2624ff25ef568d351a0712ca69fa2&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-08-27)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to was setting up &lt;a href=&#34;http://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; continuous integration. I believe this should also be part of the story in getting up and running in a new programming language environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did a Web search and figured out how to create a suitable &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;. I committed and pushed to GitHub, flipped the switch in my Travis account, and you can see its &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/tau&#34;&gt;passing status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pittsburgh Ruby/Python social and some observations about our polyglot world</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Programming meetups aren&amp;rsquo;t just about presentations and coding. Abby and I joined others in meeting up for dinner for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/120201652/&#34;&gt;joint Pittsburgh Ruby and Pittsburgh Python social&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed relaxing and socializing outdoors in Bakery Square. Although it perpetually looked like it was going to rain, it turned out we weren&amp;rsquo;t really rained on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;//instagram.com/p/ch8quus4Kb/embed/&#34; width=&#34;612&#34; height=&#34;710&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol, Andre, and Abby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/carolnichols/9425969330&#34; title=&#34;ttm! by Carol Nichols, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3754/9425969330_d8ecdbf987.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;ttm!&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fitting that there was a joint social for two language communities, because we live in a polyglot world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my original intention not to engage into any tech-related conversation, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help remarking on my current polyglot responsibilities at work at CMU on the METAL project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-polyglot-world-ruby-python-perl:f96e1a748b79a0448958de0b51234d51&#34;&gt;Our polyglot world: Ruby, Python, Perl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned having to cobble together Ruby, Python, and Perl code recently in an NLP project to process Farsi text into corpora to analyze. We used a Ruby gem &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aziz/virastar&#34;&gt;Virastar&lt;/a&gt; in our pipeline, a Perl script for a Farsi stemmer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://perstem.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Perstem&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wfeely/farsiNLPTools&#34;&gt;Python script for normalization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-12-04-c-scala-mongodb:f96e1a748b79a0448958de0b51234d51&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-12-04) C++, Scala, MongoDB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work project ended up becoming even more polyglot than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used a C++ tagger, TurboTagger from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TurboParser/&#34;&gt;TurboParser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote Scala to execute and monitor the pipeline, because it turned out that component bugs and timeouts (from infinite loops sometimes) had to be dealt with: the original shell script pipelines did not handle any of that at all. Also, the vast amount of data meant that parallelizing was critical. The Scala ecosystem has  turned out great for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use Akka actors for this task, just futures and parallel collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used MongoDB because it is quite a natural fit for document-oriented storage and querying as an intermediate stage I can inspect before the final stage of conversion to Sketch Engine format. And I happened to just &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/12/04/mongodb-free-online-course-a-review/&#34;&gt;finish a free online MongoDB course&lt;/a&gt; which has been useful. In my Scala code, I used the official Scala driver &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/casbah&#34;&gt;Casbah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why MongoDB? I needed to track the transformations, and experiment with different parameters while also fixing bugs and rerunning stuff. Because there is so much data and sometimes something crashes in the pipeline, I decided to save all intermediate results in a database in order to avoid repeating work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used Scala to generate corpora for importing into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sketchengine.co.uk/&#34;&gt;The Sketch Engine&lt;/a&gt; for our Farsi linguistics experts to analyze. Scala&amp;rsquo;s parser combinator library came in very useful, and I represented each stage in the pipeline as a transformation of a custom AST designed to finally serialize well to the Sketch Engine &amp;ldquo;vert&amp;rdquo; file format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty important to work with ASTs, since we actually got text in a variety of formats, which I parsed to a common AST in order to push into the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A description of some of this &lt;a href=&#34;http://springfield.metaphor.cs.cmu.edu:8080/MetaphorViz/About.html&#34;&gt;METAL project&lt;/a&gt; work is in the paper &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/596_Paper.pdf&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The CMU METAL Farsi NLP Approach&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Pittsburgh JavaScript&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the topic of the featured presentation by &lt;a href=&#34;http://idiotcoder.com/&#34;&gt;Richard Ashkettle&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&#34;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt;, I made sure to attend my first meeting of the newly revived &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup&lt;/a&gt;. (This was actually the third meeting of the revived Pittsburgh JavaScript group, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to make it to the first two.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d met Richard earlier, a month ago at &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/report-on-the-second-pittsburgh-techfest-2013/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh TechFest&lt;/a&gt;. He does not claim to be an expert at functional programming, but is enthusiastic about concepts and techniques that he can and does apply to improving software quality in many dimensions. Since I have been a functional programming enthusiast and practitioner for twenty years, I had these goals in attending his presentations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evaluate what Richard and others have done with, and think is important about,  functional programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer a few corrections, elaborations, suggestions as appropriate for the situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gather information on how I may be able to effectively explain functional programming to those who are new to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-the-pittsbugh-javascript-meetup-group:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;History of the Pittsbugh JavaScript meetup group&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, in 2011, I had attended the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers&#34;&gt;first incarnation of the group&lt;/a&gt; faithfully, attending several months of meetings before it disbanded when the founder left Pittsburgh. I learned quite a bit from those meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years is a long time in the world of JavaScript. Looking back at &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/09/27/when-jquery-attacks/&#34;&gt;one of my blog posts reporting on the old JavaScript meetup group&lt;/a&gt;, I am amused by how anachronistic that feels to me today, as in my mention of &lt;a href=&#34;http://sproutcore.com/&#34;&gt;Sproutcore&lt;/a&gt;, which I never hear about any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;up-front-my-take-on-the-secret-of-javascript:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Up front: my take on the secret of JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some observations (not novel) I have about JavaScript, to set the stage for further discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript is full of horrible, disgusting Bad Parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript has only one shiny Good Part: it has first-class functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People manage to get a lot of amazingly cool and important stuff done using JavaScript, so take it seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comments-on-richard-s-presentation:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Comments on Richard&amp;rsquo;s presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;immutability-and-functional-languages:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Immutability and &amp;ldquo;functional languages&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object&#34;&gt;immutability&lt;/a&gt; as being part of what &amp;ldquo;functional programming&amp;rdquo; is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is, and in addition, common best practices in many programming languages these days argue for favoring immutability. I want to emphasize that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go full-blown into a specialized &amp;ldquo;functional language&amp;rdquo; in order to take advantage of immutability as desired: for example, this tip has long since been known as at least a &amp;ldquo;design pattern&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/06/25/pittsburgh-java-user-group-building-and-evolving-a-java-api/&#34;&gt;Java world&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.harukizaemon.com/blog/2010/03/01/functional-programming-in-object-oriented-languages/&#34;&gt;Ruby world&lt;/a&gt;, and basically everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard suggested that &amp;ldquo;functional languages&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t allow mutation. By my definition, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; actually true.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t raise an objection during the talk because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to sidetrack it, but here I have space to elaborate a little. I would argue (but that would have to be another blog post) that the cleanest, most intuitive and novice-accessible &amp;ldquo;functional languages&amp;rdquo;) are those in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29&#34;&gt;ML&lt;/a&gt; family originally developed in the 1970s and lives on today&amp;rsquo;s popular, industrial-strength dialects of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML&#34;&gt;Standard ML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ocaml.org/&#34;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://fsharp.org/&#34;&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ML fully supports mutation&lt;/em&gt;, through &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Standard_ML_Programming/Types#References&#34;&gt;reference cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, because of notions like this, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking that maybe it would be best if we all stopped using the term &amp;ldquo;functional language&amp;rdquo;, because it has sadly become misleading and ambiguous. In particular, people instantly think &amp;ldquo;Haskell&amp;rdquo; when they use the word &amp;ldquo;functional language&amp;rdquo;, when in fact Haskell is a very unusual, unique language (and ecosystem) among languages that one could call &amp;ldquo;functional&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expressions-functions-evaluation-and-values:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Expressions, functions, evaluation, and values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Richard put it, &amp;ldquo;favor expressions evaluating to a value&amp;rdquo;. The focus of functional programming is on &lt;em&gt;returning&lt;/em&gt; a value, from an expression that includes function calls, rather than munging some mutable global state, or modifying state through a reference passed into a function as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;recursion-vs-looping:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Recursion vs. looping?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard noted that one characteristic of functional programming is the use of recursion instead of looping. He gave examples of writing tail-recursive functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nitpick (which again, I did not bring up during the talk): recursion and looping (as in through &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; constructs such as &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;) are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; actually opposed. I will write a blog post later about why conventional looping is best thought of as a derived construct built on top of recursion, and why it might be best to consider conventional looping to be a historical accident and mistake (but a very useful invention given the historical circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;efficiency-of-recursion:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Efficiency of recursion?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, people brought up the topic of efficiency. I have learned over the years that for many people, the word &amp;ldquo;recursion&amp;rdquo; seems to immediately trigger the word &amp;ldquo;efficiency&amp;rdquo;. Richard did a great job in mentioning that &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proper_tail_calls&#34;&gt;EMCAScript 6 is going to have proper tail calls (also called tail call optimization)&lt;/a&gt;, which will make tail recursion equivalent to ordinary looping in terms of space usage. This is &lt;em&gt;hugely important&lt;/em&gt; news, of course. This mandate shows how serious JavaScript is about embracing functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;recursion-for-parallelism:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Recursion for parallelism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond the issue tail recursion, I felt I had to point out that recursive algorithms can offer actual &lt;em&gt;speedup&lt;/em&gt;. The classic examples, of course, are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl/alg-sequence.html#quicksort&#34;&gt;parallel speedups of divide-and-conquer algorithms such as quicksort that use recursion&lt;/a&gt;. If you expressed the algorithms by removing the recursion (with a hand-rolled stack as often taught in courses), you would destroy the inherent parallelism. So in the world of parallelism, you want your code to stay naturally recursive! As &lt;a href=&#34;http://adambom.github.io/parallel.js/&#34;&gt;parallel computing comes to JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, keep this in mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;higher-order-functions-first-class-functions:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Higher-order functions, first-class functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard: &amp;ldquo;A function is an object&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really as simple as that. Functions can be created, stored, passed around. Functions can return other functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing, but I claim that this is JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s one Good Part, its killer feature that surprisingly many languages don&amp;rsquo;t have. And it&amp;rsquo;s the one feature that is used &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;, not just in esoteric code. From the very beginning, JavaScript had first-class functions, to support callbacks for client code in Web browsers. and &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; server-side code is nothing if not a whole bunch of &lt;code&gt;function (...)&lt;/code&gt;. Without closures and first-class functions, JavaScript would have been completely useless. Thank goodness &lt;a href=&#34;http://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/&#34;&gt;Brendan Eich was inspired by the Scheme functional language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;no-methods:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;No methods!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript not only provides full-fledged functions, but ironically, its weirdest feature, the prototype-based inheritance instead of class-based inheritance, inadvertently has prevented &amp;ldquo;interference&amp;rdquo; from the conventional class-based object-oriented world, which is mostly based not on functions, but on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_%28computer_programming%29&#34;&gt;methods&lt;/a&gt; that interference with functions because they are meant to &lt;em&gt;replace&lt;/em&gt; functions (since according to &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; object-oriented thinking, functions are evil and computation should involve method calls on objects). &lt;em&gt;JavaScript does not (really) have methods&lt;/em&gt;; it only simulates them, by storing bona fide closures into fields of (map) objects. For example, if you use &lt;a href=&#34;http://emberjs.com&#34;&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;, the following code illustrates how the building blocks of typical JavaScript programming involve creating lots of &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;s: &lt;code&gt;valueWillChange&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;valudDidChange&lt;/code&gt; are just functions. They are not special things, &amp;ldquo;methods&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;App.PersonView &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Ember.View.extend({
  valueWillChange&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (obj, keyName, value) {
    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.changingFrom &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value;
  }.observesBefore(&lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;content.value&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;),
  valueDidChange&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(obj, keyName, value) {
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #408080; font-style: italic&#34;&gt;// only run if updating a value already in the DOM&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.get(&lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;state&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;inDOM&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;) {
          &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; color &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.changingFrom &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;green&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;red&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
          &lt;span style=&#34;color: #408080; font-style: italic&#34;&gt;// logic&lt;/span&gt;
      }
  }.observes(&lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;content.value&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
});
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;examples:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard gave some standard examples of using higher-order functions such as &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; as provided in various popular JavaScript libraries such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://underscorejs.org/&#34;&gt;Underscore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of style, he recommended against long, obscure one-liners that involve chaining. I agree. For readability and testability of pipelines, I have found that it is good to break things up into intermediate steps. (Just &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/06/26/pittsburgh-python-night-of-the-favorite-module/&#34;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Lesher also recommended against stupidity masking as excessive cleverness in his Python lightning talk about functional programming with &lt;code&gt;itertools&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monads:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Monads?!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, Richard brought up the term &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;monads&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m close to thinking that this word should be &lt;a href=&#34;http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/why-i-wont-be-writing-a-monad-tutorial/&#34;&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt;, because too many confusions about them have ruined the word. I have yet decided what the best alternative phrase might be. Maybe something like &amp;ldquo;computational context&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Richard admitted he was going to abuse the word, and for the sake of example, he said, he was going to say that &amp;ldquo;jQuery is a monad&amp;rdquo;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to derail his talk, and since he admitted the abuse, I decided there would be a better time to address this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to me, however, that he gathered that the interesting thing about jQuery, and why he wanted to call it a monad, was the chaining of calls in jQuery. I need to think of a good way to deal with this intuition when I get around to explaining monads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;partial-application-and-currying:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Partial application and currying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard explained both partial application and currying, then he wondered when one would in practice write a curried function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said (but not very convincingly, I think) that you would write a curried function if you knew you would otherwise have to manually do a bunch of partial application. I have to confess that was a weak answer. I think the practical situation in JavaScript is that full-scale up-front currying is not useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;libraries:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard recommended checking out the following libraries, especially Lo-Dash, which he judges to be faster than Underscore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://underscorejs.org/&#34;&gt;Underscore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lodash.com/&#34;&gt;Lo-Dash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/&#34;&gt;Functional JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions-and-answers:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Questions and answers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many interesting questions raised after the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-functional-programming-into-a-team-environment:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Introducing functional programming into a team environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone asked Richard a good question about whether it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to, say, start using Underscore at work and expecting other team members to learn how to use it. Is it fair to expect others to learn a new way of doing things that might seem weird?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point of view is that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing specific about functional programming when it comes to questions like this. The same question comes up when evaluating a particular programming language or a particular MVC framework or a particular version control system, and the answer involve considering all the different realities of who is comfortable with what, whether it is worth learning something new, what the advantages and disadvantages are, how much the decision will affect delivery of business value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;growing-parameter-list-for-a-function-vs-passing-in-a-big-object:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Growing parameter list for a function vs. passing in a big object&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concern brought up is that if you&amp;rsquo;re programming in a functional style, you can end up being faced with ever-growing parameter lists for a function to pass in everything that it needs. One solution is to create a big object to stick everything into it that might be needed (for example, a configuration object instead of separate flag parameters). Is this overkill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tonylukasavage.com/&#34;&gt;Tony Lukasavage&lt;/a&gt; emphasized that his concern was in the context of the need to evolve an existing API without breaking customers&amp;rsquo; client code that uses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first note would be that API design is tricky and checking out &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/blog/2013/06/25/pittsburgh-java-user-group-building-and-evolving-a-java-api/&#34;&gt;some resources on API design&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding parameter lists, Richard noted that you might have a design problem if you have a function that needs to know about so many things it depends on. You may want to refactor the function (of course, in the context of evolving a mature API that customers depend on, it may be too late, unfortunately) and the data structures passed in. For example, if you have a number of functions that all take as parameters a &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt;, then maybe you want a single &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggested also that if certain flags are not always needed, then instead of a huge configuration object, how about simply having separate but related functions (in a language supporting overloading, you could provide overloaded functions, although the topic of overloading is another large one to discuss later), each of which takes only the flags the client cares about. Of course, as some people pointed out, then you might end up with annoyingly long and specific function names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody said designing an API is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-actually-do-functional-programming:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Do I actually do functional programming?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question I got, since before the meetup, I had indicated having experience with functional programming, was basically, do I actually use it in JavaScript and elsewhere. The answer is, yes. As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned, you don&amp;rsquo;t have use a special language in order to program in this way, although it&amp;rsquo;s much easier and more efficient to use a language that is tailored to support it. Most of the code I&amp;rsquo;ve written in the past fifteen years has attempted to be primarily functional in style, whatever language I&amp;rsquo;m using for work (mostly Java, Perl, Python, and recently Scala). I don&amp;rsquo;t do this out of some kind of ideology, but because it works well in getting stuff done. Before adopting a primarily functional style of programming, I spent years working in traditional imperative and object-oriented styles, and empirically, that was less pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;do-i-do-functional-programming-in-javascript:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Do I do functional programming in JavaScript?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not actually done any JavaScript programming for work since doing some UI prototyping two years ago. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when I&amp;rsquo;ll return to doing front end work, but meanwhile, I am interested in doing some Web browser stuff for personal projects, so I try to keep up to date on developments in the JavaScript world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that has been interesting that I need to check out is the rise of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming&#34;&gt;functional reactive programming (FRP)&lt;/a&gt; libraries for JavaScript, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js&#34;&gt;Bacon.js&lt;/a&gt;. FRP was originally invented in the 1990s by Conal Elliott in the context of Haskell, but almost twenty years later, has finally spread well beyond that now to mainstream visibility and use. For example, Microsoft has thrown its weight behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://rx.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;Reactive Extensions (Rx)&lt;/a&gt;, which started out in the .NET world, but Microsoft then ported it to JavaScript, C/C++, Python, and Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:4a05566a34ea27820d7f737863a690ea&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see interest in functional programming in the local JavaScript community. Richard gave an introductory talk on it that I thought was very useful as a starting point for those who are new to it. I made note of some omissions or inaccuracies in order to improve my thinking about how I can contribute in the future to improving people&amp;rsquo;s understanding and application of functional programming principles.&lt;/p&gt;
