&lt;p&gt;I am not a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; developer. I&amp;rsquo;ve only used Node to play around with JavaScript, not for any real work or personal projects (yet). The last time I used Node was two months ago, for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/06/01/pittsburgh-tech-fest-2013-my-talk-stop-overusing-regular-expressions/&#34;&gt;talk I gave at Pittsburgh TechFest 2013&lt;/a&gt; in which I wrote JavaScript code running on Node, but did not actually talk about it, and only mentioned that I had written it and put it up on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/franklinchen/talk-on-overusing-regular-expressions&#34;&gt;GitHub repository for the talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why it took me so long to attend my first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Node&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Node-js/events/128439692/&#34;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt;. I was simply curious who was involved in the local Node community and what tooling they were using. The meeting was about &lt;a href=&#34;http://gruntjs.com/&#34;&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, a Make-like task runner. Nate Good of ShowClix presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;attendance:89eab02fcac62478e1d2cec2100846be&#34;&gt;Attendance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a fairly large group of people who attended: around thirty. Node seems to be popular in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-talk:89eab02fcac62478e1d2cec2100846be&#34;&gt;The talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Grunt seemed like Make or Rake. You can use plugins and define your own tasks. So there seemed nothing special about it, other than it is a useful tool corresponding to similar tools for other language ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:89eab02fcac62478e1d2cec2100846be&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;rsquo;t really use Node, I went to the meetup out of curiosity more than anything else. I will probably not attend again. There seemed a lot of enthusiasm though.&lt;/p&gt;
