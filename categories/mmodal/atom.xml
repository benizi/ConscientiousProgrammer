&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Scala Meetup&lt;/a&gt; met, with me presenting a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/events/146581402/&#34;&gt;practice talk&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;ldquo;Exploring type-directed, test-driven development using FizzBuzz&amp;rdquo;, which I am presenting at the upcoming local &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghtechfest.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh TechFest&lt;/a&gt; conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation:0ca97438327f3bcfe743d5a186e4af3e&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only recently completed the slides and code for my talk, and had not actually given the talk yet, so this was a practice talk that did not go so well, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke too quickly and had too much material to cover, and also got lost in some of my own slides. Oops. I think reaction to my talk was mixed. Some enjoyed it, while others seemed lost at places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going home, I frankly felt that I had &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I believe I can do much better. I have plenty of time to do a thorough revision before Pittsburgh TechFest in three weeks. I need to cut out material that is not needed for the core of what I am trying to achieve and make some things clearer (especially for the intended Pittsburgh TechFest audience, which I do not expect to even know Scala).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;supporting-material:0ca97438327f3bcfe743d5a186e4af3e&#34;&gt;Supporting material&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FranklinChen/talk-on-type-directed-tdd-using-fizzbuzz&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend looking at them, but for historical purposes, here are slides of the presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FranklinChen/talk-on-type-directed-tdd-using-fizzbuzz/blob/meetup/doc/presentation.pdf&#34;&gt;as it was given in the first draft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-05-16:0ca97438327f3bcfe743d5a186e4af3e&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-05-16)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day makes a difference in my confidence and determination! I noticed that the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Code and Supply&lt;/a&gt; group (which I have not yet attended) is soon having its inaugural &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rust-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/181773312/&#34;&gt;soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to offer to do a version of my talk for Pittsburgh Code and Supply using Rust as the programming language (rather than Scala). I want to spread the news about how to effectively use a sufficiently typed programming language, whether it&amp;rsquo;s Scala or Rust or anything else sufficiently derived from the ML family of type systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin will schedule it for some time in July. That should give me enough time, after Pittsburgh TechFest in early June, to learn enough Rust to convert my Scala code over properly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-06-07:0ca97438327f3bcfe743d5a186e4af3e&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-06-07)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I much improved the presentation for Pittsburgh TechFest, which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/06/07/report-on-the-2014-pittsburgh-techfest-my-third-year/&#34;&gt;attended for the third year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend reading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FranklinChen/talk-on-type-directed-tdd-using-fizzbuzz/blob/master/doc/article.pdf&#34;&gt;article version of the presentation&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the slides. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve created both an article version of a presentation and slides for use during the live presentation. I will do this in the future as well. Slides are not meant to stand alone or even be read alone, but in case you really want to see them, they are here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/37257104&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px&#34;&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/FranklinChen/presentation-37257104&#34; title=&#34;Exploring type-directed, test-driven development: a case study using FizzBuzz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Exploring type-directed, test-driven development: a case study using FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/FranklinChen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Franklin Chen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-07-17:0ca97438327f3bcfe743d5a186e4af3e&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-07-17)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s crunch time. My Rust version of the talk, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/183483622/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Type-Directed TDD in Rust&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is coming next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pittsburgh Scala Meetup: Implicits</title>
      <link>http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2014/02/13/pittsburgh-scala-meetup-implicits/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Scala Meetup&lt;/a&gt; met with Justin presenting on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/events/146581402/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Implicits&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implicits:e863a7ec4a3ba48279ebb2581682b028&#34;&gt;Implicits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implicits are a novel and fantastically important feature of Scala. I wish there were a comprehensive and concise single resource about them out there, but I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing stuff with implicits lately. Not long ago, I wrote a blog post that involved &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/12/26/tostring-considered-harmful-part-2/&#34;&gt;using Scala implicits to avoid relying on the inherited Java &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, for this meetup I posted some code that I hoped someone would comment on, in which &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/franklinchen/test-specs2-matchers&#34;&gt;I used implicits to try to simplify a DSL&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure this is the right design choice, but it was an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation:e863a7ec4a3ba48279ebb2581682b028&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 7 of us showed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin did some live coding using the Scala Worksheet to demonstrate various uses of implicits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One use is to define an &amp;ldquo;implicit function&amp;rdquo; that can convert of a value of one type to another. This can be overused badly, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is to define an &amp;ldquo;implicit parameter&amp;rdquo; for a function so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to explicitly pass a parameter to the function, if there is an implicit value in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scala 2.10 greatly improved implicits by encapsulating the &amp;ldquo;conversion&amp;rdquo; pattern by means of an &amp;ldquo;implicit class&amp;rdquo;. Strangely, Scala Worksheet seemed to get confused when we played around and defined an implicit class that also had an implicit parameter. This led to some interesting detective work as we examined the generated JVM byte code to figure out what was going on! I thought it was useful for us to dig into this level; often it is useful to understand what something compiles to in order to better understand and appreciate a high-level language construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we briefly discussed the type class pattern, which is arguably the most important use of implicits. This was too big a topic to get into here though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources:e863a7ec4a3ba48279ebb2581682b028&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted some good resources that have popped up on my radar on Scala implicits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fine &lt;a href=&#34;http://like-a-boss.net/2013/03/29/polymorphism-and-typeclasses-in-scala.html&#34;&gt;tutorial on type classes in Scala&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://typelevel.org/blog/2014/01/18/implicitly_existential.html&#34;&gt;Scary stuff with implicits&lt;/a&gt; that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand (yet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:e863a7ec4a3ba48279ebb2581682b028&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin gave a nice introduction to implicits. I think the live coding and experimentation is a great way to involve people in code suggestions and discussion of what things mean and do. It was a fun time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pittsburgh Scala Meetup: Introduction to Reactive</title>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Scala Meetup&lt;/a&gt; met with Josh presenting an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/events/146581352/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Introduction to Reactive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-meetup-dinner:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;Pre-meetup dinner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of us (Justin, Josh, Chris, me) had an early dinner at Everyday Noodles before the meetup. Very filling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;turnout:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;Turnout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten of us showed up for this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-reactive-anyway:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;rdquo; anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear about it in the media, the term &amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;rdquo; has been popularized in recent months, and I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/12/31/review-of-the-free-coursera-course-principles-of-reactive-programming/&#34;&gt;reviewed the free Coursera course &amp;ldquo;Principles of Reactive Programming&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that some of us in the Pittsburgh Scala group just completed, so check out my post for more on &amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;futures:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;Futures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh did a live SBT session reviewing futures and promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He noted that futures have limitations as a component of reactive systems. (This had become apparent when &lt;a href=&#34;http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/25/openhack-pittsburgh-exploring-scala-odds-and-ends/&#34;&gt;I started using futures last year in my personal projects&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/02/pittsburgh-ruby-python-social/&#34;&gt;for work&lt;/a&gt;.) By themselves, futures do not support cancellation or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure&#34;&gt;back pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Futures are a low-level, limited mechanism that are the right tool only if you have a pipeline all the way through forward, no back channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative to futures, of course, is to go all out and use Akka actors. But the drawback I&amp;rsquo;ve found with that is that this is a heavyweight mechanism for problems that don&amp;rsquo;t need the full power of actors. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted something more structured and lightweight than using actors directly. I find it tricky to program using actors, because it is very easy to start writing spaghetti code that is spread out everywhere (which is what happened to me in the final project for the Coursera course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, according to Josh, that Typesafe is working on precisely this problem! Nice. He&amp;rsquo;ll tell us more when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2014-07-10:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-07-10)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a year later, the promise was realized, as the Pittsburgh Scala Meetup had Josh &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/07/10/pittsburgh-scala-meetup-reactive-streams/&#34;&gt;gave a talk on the new API called Reactive Streams&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;play:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh demonstrated &lt;a href=&#34;http://typesafe.com/activator&#34;&gt;Typesafe Activator&lt;/a&gt;, the cool new Web browser-based platform for using Scala. He showed an app using Play that looks at blogs simultaneously and uses &lt;code&gt;recoverWith&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;random-other-questions-and-discussions:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;Random other questions and discussions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about the Pittsburgh Scala Meetup is that even when we have a presentation, discussion often wanders off to related topics (or unrelated topics). Anything goes, and I usually learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone asked about support for channels as in Go or Clojure&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clojure/core.async&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;core.async&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Josh said they&amp;rsquo;re working on this sort of thing with support for back pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone asked about how to connect &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/Iteratees&#34;&gt;iteratees&lt;/a&gt; with actors. Josh said, you can feed from an iteratee to an actor, and then just let the actor do stuff. However, there is some controversy about the whole iteratee thing in Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:1fbca7bab37ee55bb74190d8ff39e5b7&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a great Pittsburgh Scala Meetup session. I felt that a lot of questions that had built up in my mind after having gotten into reactive programming are being addressed with continuing work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pittsburgh Scala Meetup: code walk through tic-tac-toe with Play</title>
      <link>http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2013/12/05/pittsburgh-scala-meetup-code-walk-through-tic-tac-toe-with-play/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Scala Meetup&lt;/a&gt; met again with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/events/146581232/&#34;&gt;Josh walking through his code for an interactive Web tic-tac-toe program implemented with Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good session. I&amp;rsquo;m finding that studying code (with the code&amp;rsquo;s author present) is a great way to learn, to discuss design decisions and alternate possible choices that could have been made. For example, when it comes to actors, there are decisions to be made about how many actors, what state they should contain, and how to transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pittsburgh Scala Meetup: learning by reading Josh&#39;s code!</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Scala Meetup&lt;/a&gt; met to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/events/135567132/&#34;&gt;learn by hacking&lt;/a&gt;. There was a change of plan because Josh couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the meeting, so instead of a presentation by him, we got a link to his GitHub repository for an implementation of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jsuereth/tic-tac-toe&#34;&gt;interactive Web-based tic-tac-toe game using Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes interesting things happen when plans are changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-josh-s-code:95e88fa2aaa4d8fe2bdc4ba1715abea1&#34;&gt;Reading Josh&amp;rsquo;s code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Josh wasn&amp;rsquo;t around, we decided to study his code, and use it as the basis of discussion of Scala language features and idiomatic style, making sure that all of us understood what the code was doing. This turned out to be a surprisingly useful exercise, very participatory by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin took charge of an SBT session as we played with modifying the code and figuring out what things did. I shared some tips on using SBT in &amp;ldquo;trigger mode&amp;rdquo;, which some had not known about. While experimenting, we ran into interesting Scala gotchas involving &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; in classes that mix in traits. We also had useful discussions on coding style, such as point-free style and use of underscores in closures, and converting between curried and uncurried functions. My personal point of view is that I prefer to be more explicit rather than more concise, to improve clarity, but much does depend on assumptions about people&amp;rsquo;s prior knowledge. Josh was writing this code for only himself, and the complete application was actually not meant to showcase the tic-tac-toe game logic anyway, but the use of Play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:95e88fa2aaa4d8fe2bdc4ba1715abea1&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a really useful session in which we all helped one other get up to speed on various Scala language features or standard library APIs. We all learned something new, and we figured out Josh&amp;rsquo;s code, and collected questions to ask him when he comes back!&lt;/p&gt;
