      <description>

&lt;p&gt;By sheer accident, while I was looking for something else online, I
came across a Web site for &lt;a href=&#34;http://aegis.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;, a
distributed version control system I used at work back in 1995-1997. I
was surprised this software was still alive after twenty years. A lot
of software has a very short life span, and since I had not heard
anything about Aegis all this time, I would have guessed that it had
died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered that we had used this software along with another tool
the author developed, called
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/cook.README&#34;&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt;, which was a
replacement for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29&#34;&gt;Make&lt;/a&gt;. I was
unsuccessful in locating any official Web site for Cook, so I assume
it is more or less dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I found by coincidence that actually, the author,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Miller_%28software_engineer%29&#34;&gt;Peter Miller&lt;/a&gt;,
died less than a year ago (July 2014). There was enough memory of him
that someone wrote that Wikipedia page on his contributions to open
source software. However, his Web site &lt;code&gt;http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/
&lt;/code&gt;, sadly, has died with him, and with that, the site he had on Cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that the Web is &amp;ldquo;forever&amp;rdquo;, right? Let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this old photo, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;wayback-machine:a626c37eefef6cb88a3f2de686a3eafc&#34;&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I checked the Wayback Machine, and it has some snapshots of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/&#34;&gt;his site&lt;/a&gt;. The
last working snapshot was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20090111230031/http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/&#34;&gt;from 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is his old
&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20090327074944/http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/software/&#34;&gt;software page&lt;/a&gt;. Yes,
it includes a link to a Cook site, but it leads to a nonexistent
snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped because I am not that interested in reliving the early
history of Cook. I never met the guy, although I believe I exchanged
email with him when it was just his personal project and he was &amp;ldquo;tech
support&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how historians fifty years from now will be working. So much
is no longer on paper, but stored in random archives on hard drives
somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:a626c37eefef6cb88a3f2de686a3eafc&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software dies, people die. It was just weird for me to accidentally do
a bit of sleuthing to find more information about someone whose
software I once used a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo; for my code. I suppose I should have a plan in
place for whatever I value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a plan for your Web site or code or writings? Or do you
  expect them to disappear? How do you feel about leaving something
  behind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2015-06-29:a626c37eefef6cb88a3f2de686a3eafc&#34;&gt;(Update of 2015-06-29)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By accident, while reading an old blog post by Graydon Hoare about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/graydon/bors&#34;&gt;bors&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for continuous
integration for the Rust project, I noticed his
&lt;a href=&#34;http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html&#34;&gt;shoutout to Peter Miller for Aegis&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s
great that Peter Miller&amp;rsquo;s work inspired others to build systems that
are used today. One random person&amp;rsquo;s ideas and software made a lasting
difference in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
