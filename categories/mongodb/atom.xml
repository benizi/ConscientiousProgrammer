    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I finally finished a two-month &lt;a href=&#34;http://education.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;free online course on MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;, given by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;MongoDB, Inc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a review of the specific course numbered M101J, &amp;ldquo;MongoDB for Java Developers&amp;rdquo;, but it should apply to all thee introductory developer courses on MongoDB in any language, because actually, I had originally signed up months earlier for their original course (in JavaScript), and the content is largely the same (I had gotten busy and dropped that course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-learn-mongodb:0d4164e2dd5b7ba3716ef93bdba00ac4&#34;&gt;Why learn MongoDB?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had first heard of MongoDB over two years ago, at a meeting of the (now defunct) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/&#34;&gt;original Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/events/25229441/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;In-depth look at Node.js and NoSQL&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB has become very popular; as far as I can tell, this is because of extreme marketing efforts, as well as the fact that it is very easy to get started doing stuff with it, being a document-oriented NoSQL database requiring no schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this course in part to expose myself to some NoSQL technology and also in part because I anticipated needing to use something like it. In fact, it turns out &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/02/pittsburgh-ruby-python-social/&#34;&gt;I did use it&lt;/a&gt;, heavily, in exactly the kind of use case that works fine with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-take-the-java-version-of-the-course:0d4164e2dd5b7ba3716ef93bdba00ac4&#34;&gt;Why did I take the Java version of the course?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the &amp;ldquo;M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers&amp;rdquo; version of the course because I anticipated writing code in Scala to access MongoDB. In fact, during the course, I ended up using the official Scala driver &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/casbah&#34;&gt;Casbah&lt;/a&gt; when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-the-course:0d4164e2dd5b7ba3716ef93bdba00ac4&#34;&gt;Summary of the course&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the course actually involved using the JavaScript-based MongoDB shell, which makes sense because it is easy to explore data that way. Since everything is JSON-like, there&amp;rsquo;s no real escaping JavaScript if you&amp;rsquo;re working with MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video lecture/quiz/assignment format is fairly standard for MOOCs, and worked fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was more work than I expected, because it lasted so long, two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ad hoc nature of MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s API (including the Java-based one) tended to bother me throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weird CRUD syntax, shoehorning everything into a JSON representation, took some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to specify indexes and to evaluate your guesses about whether they are actually working the way you expected was to look at funny values in JSON. I found this low-level and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aggregation API seemed even weirder. Overall, everything had a loose &amp;ldquo;dynamic&amp;rdquo; feel to it: this is the essence of MongoDB, really. Doing things wrong made me frustrated because of the runtime errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the sections on replication and sharding were particularly problematic. The lectures kept mentioning that various defaults and APIs were a moving target. Furthermore, actual hardcoded numbers even showed up that we were supposed to use to specify policies. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:0d4164e2dd5b7ba3716ef93bdba00ac4&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lectures and quizzes were well-designed (until the final portion of the course that seemed particularly ad hoc). The assignments were sometimes rather tricky, with not much of a hint, but offered a decent variety of realistic query formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend this course as an overview to anyone who is committed to using MongoDB to its full extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although I got my &amp;ldquo;certificate&amp;rdquo; for completing the course, and appreciate that MongoDB, Inc offers this training for free, I felt that there was a lot of ad hoc stuff going on in the evolving design of MongoDB, and embedded in the API design as well. For what I needed to know for my work, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really need the whole course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pittsburgh Ruby/Python social and some observations about our polyglot world</title>

&lt;p&gt;Programming meetups aren&amp;rsquo;t just about presentations and coding. Abby and I joined others in meeting up for dinner for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/120201652/&#34;&gt;joint Pittsburgh Ruby and Pittsburgh Python social&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed relaxing and socializing outdoors in Bakery Square. Although it perpetually looked like it was going to rain, it turned out we weren&amp;rsquo;t really rained on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;//instagram.com/p/ch8quus4Kb/embed/&#34; width=&#34;612&#34; height=&#34;710&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol, Andre, and Abby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/carolnichols/9425969330&#34; title=&#34;ttm! by Carol Nichols, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3754/9425969330_d8ecdbf987.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;ttm!&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fitting that there was a joint social for two language communities, because we live in a polyglot world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my original intention not to engage into any tech-related conversation, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help remarking on my current polyglot responsibilities at work at CMU on the METAL project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-polyglot-world-ruby-python-perl:f96e1a748b79a0448958de0b51234d51&#34;&gt;Our polyglot world: Ruby, Python, Perl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned having to cobble together Ruby, Python, and Perl code recently in an NLP project to process Farsi text into corpora to analyze. We used a Ruby gem &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aziz/virastar&#34;&gt;Virastar&lt;/a&gt; in our pipeline, a Perl script for a Farsi stemmer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://perstem.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Perstem&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wfeely/farsiNLPTools&#34;&gt;Python script for normalization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-12-04-c-scala-mongodb:f96e1a748b79a0448958de0b51234d51&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-12-04) C++, Scala, MongoDB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work project ended up becoming even more polyglot than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used a C++ tagger, TurboTagger from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TurboParser/&#34;&gt;TurboParser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote Scala to execute and monitor the pipeline, because it turned out that component bugs and timeouts (from infinite loops sometimes) had to be dealt with: the original shell script pipelines did not handle any of that at all. Also, the vast amount of data meant that parallelizing was critical. The Scala ecosystem has  turned out great for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use Akka actors for this task, just futures and parallel collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used MongoDB because it is quite a natural fit for document-oriented storage and querying as an intermediate stage I can inspect before the final stage of conversion to Sketch Engine format. And I happened to just &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/12/04/mongodb-free-online-course-a-review/&#34;&gt;finish a free online MongoDB course&lt;/a&gt; which has been useful. In my Scala code, I used the official Scala driver &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/casbah&#34;&gt;Casbah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why MongoDB? I needed to track the transformations, and experiment with different parameters while also fixing bugs and rerunning stuff. Because there is so much data and sometimes something crashes in the pipeline, I decided to save all intermediate results in a database in order to avoid repeating work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used Scala to generate corpora for importing into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sketchengine.co.uk/&#34;&gt;The Sketch Engine&lt;/a&gt; for our Farsi linguistics experts to analyze. Scala&amp;rsquo;s parser combinator library came in very useful, and I represented each stage in the pipeline as a transformation of a custom AST designed to finally serialize well to the Sketch Engine &amp;ldquo;vert&amp;rdquo; file format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty important to work with ASTs, since we actually got text in a variety of formats, which I parsed to a common AST in order to push into the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A description of some of this &lt;a href=&#34;http://springfield.metaphor.cs.cmu.edu:8080/MetaphorViz/About.html&#34;&gt;METAL project&lt;/a&gt; work is in the paper &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/596_Paper.pdf&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The CMU METAL Farsi NLP Approach&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
